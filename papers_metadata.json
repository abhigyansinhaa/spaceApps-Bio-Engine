The betacoronavirus continues to evolve with global health implications as we race to learn more to curb its transmission, evolution, and sequelae. The focus of this review, the second of  three-part series, is on the biological effects of the SARS-CoV- virus on post-acute disease in the context of tissue and organ adaptations and damage. We highlight the current knowledge and describe how virological, animal, and clinical studies have shed light on the mechanisms driving the varied clinical diagnoses and observations of COVID-19 patients. Moreover, we describe how investigations into SARS-CoV- effects have informed the understanding of viral pathogenesis and provide innovative pathways for future research on the mechanisms of viral diseases. European Journal of Human Genetics (2024) 32:10 20;  INTRODUCTION As of January 13, 2023, over 671 million cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) worldwide have been reported, and more than .71 million lives have been claimed globally. The COVID-19 pandemic is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  (SARS-CoV-) virus. The development and administration of vaccines and antiviral therapeutics against SARS-CoV- signi cantly reduced the local to global impact and burden of COVID-19. However, the global distribution of these resources has been unequal [], ultimately prolonging viral transmission. Moreover, SARS-CoV- quickly evolved into variants with increased transmission rates more capable of immune escape []. Therefore, we must increase our understanding of this novel virus, its variants, and the resulting short- and long-term effects of COVID-19 on human health. SARS-CoV- belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, which includes viruses such as OC43, HKU1, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV []. SARS-CoV- is an enveloped positive-sense RNA virus, whose genome is packaged in  helical ribonucleocapsid complex. The outer surface of the virus is studded with Spike () proteins that facilitate the infection of host cells by binding to its cognate cellular surface receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme  (ACE2) Received: 16 January 2023 Revised:  September 2023 Accepted: 13 September 2023 Published online:  November 2023 1COVID-19 International Research Team, Medford, MA 02155, USA. 2Department of Health, Nutrition and Food Sciences, Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL 32301, USA. 3Center for Mitochondrial and Epigenomic Medicine, Division of Human Genetics, The Children  Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. 4Center for Translational Data Science, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA. 5Clever Research Lab, Spring eld, IL 62704, USA. 6Departments of Oncology and Medicine and the Sidney Comprehensive Cancer Center, The Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, Baltimore, MD, USA. 7Human Healthspan, Resilience, and Performance, Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, Pensacola, FL 32502, USA. 8Sansum Diabetes Research Institute, Santa Barbara, CA 93015, USA. 9Department of Physiology, Biophysics and Systems Biology, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA. 10Laboratory of Virology and Infectious Disease, The Rockefeller University, New York, NY 10065, USA. 11Cures Within Reach, Chicago, IL 60602, USA. 12Campus and Domain Champions Program, Multi-Tier Assistance, Training, and Computational Help (MATCH) Track, National Science Foundation  Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services and Support (ACCESS), Philadelphia, PA, USA. 13Expert Network, Penn Center for Innovation, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA. 14Biometrics and Nanotechnology Councils, Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers, New York, NY 10016, USA. 15Peace Innovation Institute, The Hague 2511, Netherlands and Stanford University, Palo Alto 94305 CA, USA. 16Instituto de Medicina Molecular Jo  Lobo Antunes, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Lisboa, 1649-028 Lisboa, Portugal. 17MEtRICs, Department of Chemistry, NOVA School of Science and Technology, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, 2829-516 Caparica, Portugal. 18Atal Bihari Vajpayee Institute of Medical Sciences and Dr Ram Mannohar Lohia Hospital, New Delhi 110001, India. 19Department of Genetics, Microbiology and Immunology, Institute of Biology, University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil. 20Experimental Medicine Research Cluster (EMRC) and Obesity and Comorbidities Research Center (OCRC), University of Campinas, Campinas, Brazil. 21Facultad de Ingenier , Universidad Nacional de Asunci , San Lorenzo, Paraguay. 22New York Genome Center, New York, NY, USA. 23The Feil Family Brain and Mind Research Institute, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA. 24Fogarty International Center, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. 25Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Department of Medicine, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA. 26Department of Physiology and Biophysics, Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY, USA. 27McAllister Heart Institute and Department of Pharmacology, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, USA. 28Basic and Applied Virology Lab, Department of Microbiology, Institute for Biological Sciences (ICB), Federal University of Minas Gerais, Belo Horizonte, MG, Brazil. 29Genetics Program, Department of Genetics, Development and Cell Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 90011, USA. 30Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Program, Center for Metabolomics, Department of Genetics, Development and Cell Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, IA 90011, USA. 31Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research, Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA 02142, USA. 32Blue Marble Space Institute of Science, Space Biosciences Division, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, Santa Clara, CA 94035, USA. 33These authors contributed equally: .

Fusion leads to viral genome transfer into the host cell cytoplasm where viral replication can commence, leading to its various intracellular impacts. To read in more detail these processes, as well as structural elements of the SARS-CoV- virus, see our  rst review, ref. [], focusing on intracellular SARS- CoV- viral effects []. In this second of  three-part comprehensive series of our series of SARS-CoV- reviews, we cover the extracellular and circulating signals and physiological effects of the viral disease, including the consequences and remodeling of organs, metabolism, humoral factors, and the immune system. In turn, the aim of this review series is to provide an overview of our current knowledge of SARS- CoV- and its biological effects from basic biology to clinical patient outcomes, highlighting also future areas of research given the ever-evolving nature of SARS-CoV-,COVID-19, and its consequences for healthcare across the world. METABOLIC ADAPTATIONS CAUSED DIRECTLY BY VIRAL INFECTION OF CELLS We previously described [] SARS-CoV- viral infection intracellular effects and host adaptations. These include major shifts in metabolic and biochemical pathways, including the oxidative phosphorylation and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle []. The immune system is also involved in these adaptations, with  study showing upregulation of Type  interferon (IFN) gene signaling pathways leading to changes with cellular responses to IFN and triggering changes with associated cytokine-mediated signaling pathways []. These stimuli lead to cellular adaptations including endoplasmic reticulum stress, upregulated unfolded protein response and downregulation of pathways including spliceosome-mediated RNA processing, mitochondrial electron transport chain inhibition, and impairment in the biogenesis and assembly of the electron transport chain complexes and oxidative phosphorylation [, ]. Indeed, SARS-CoV- infection leads to decreased mitochondrial function, increased glycolysis, and shunting towards the pentose  phosphate pathway, resulting in changes in cellular metabolism and bioenergetics that lead to pathophysiological outcomes. These various cellular biochemical adaptations also result in production of circulating metabolites in COVID-19 patients that lead to systemic effects, including tissue remodeling and function, shifts in whole-body metabolism and bioenergetics, changes with immune and endocrine state, etc., resulting in the symptoms and disease outcomes seen with COVID-19 patients. For example, the TCA cycle is the main cellular source of energy and critical for aerobic respiration; serum levels of the TCA metabolites (citrate, fumarate, malate, and aconitate) were signi cantly lower in the SARS-CoV--infected patients as compared with controls, with choline speci cally observed to be decreased in patients with severe COVID-19 []. Serum metabolites that were increased in these patients included deoxy-thymidine, deoxyuridine, adenine, cystine, and homocysteine. These data provide context as to how speci  biochemical and physiological pathways, .., the TCA cycle, shift as  result of COVID-19 infection and lead to pathogenesis. For example, elevated homocysteine is associated with endothelial damage []. These shifts in metabolites re ect  systemic shift during acute COVID-19 infection, and warrant study of subsequent speci  organ adaptations (.., bone as  major source of citrate, which is released into the plasma during bone resorption, with soft tissues not generally providing  signi cant source of citrate into blood plasma). Separate from metabolic pathways (.., oxidative phosphoryla- tion, glycolysis, etc.) that produce energy from sugars are alternative pathways that utilize compounds such as lipids. Excess energy is stored in the form of lipids, with lipids also used as an immediate energy source or for later use. Lipids also serve as second messengers, activating protein and immune pathways. Indeed, it has been reported SARS-CoV- infection causes lipids levels to change and lipid metabolism to alter, with one study using untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic approaches obser- ving speci  circulating lipids associated with SARS-CoV- infection, including increases in triglycerides and free fatty acids (.., arachidonic acid and oleic acid). These lipids also correlated with disease severity []. speci  class of lipids are lipid mediators (LMs), which are bioactive lipids produced locally in response to extracellular stimuli and are involved in immune regulation. Studies have investigated their role in relation to COVID-19 severity as well. One report involving 19 healthy patients, 18 COVID-19 patients who did not need ICU admission (mild), and 20 patients that needed ICU admission (severe) showed an increase of free poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and diminished amounts of PUFA-containing plasmalogens in patients with COVID-19 that also correlated with disease severity [10]. Another study performing metabolomics and lipidomics measurements on patients (49 subjects, 33 were COVID- 19 positive subjects and 16 COVID-19 negative subjects) showed alterations in fatty acid metabolism that were associated with SARS-CoV- infection. More speci cally, short- and medium-chain acylcarnitines were signi cantly diminished in all patients with COVID-19, while all Non-Esteri ed Fatty Acids (except nonanoic acid) were increased in all COVID-19 patients [11, 12]. In summary, SARS-CoV- infection affects whole-body metabo- lism in different ways, with emerging evidence supporting  correlation between these adaptations and COVID-19 disease severity. Moreover, the balance of biochemical components, whether the machinery (.., TCA proteins), fuel sources (.., lipids), or messenger molecules (.., metabolites) appear to shift towards  physiological catabolic state that may be further exacerbated by  patient  underlying conditions and demo- graphics [,  12]. Metabolic biofactors are also intrinsically tied with the recovery and response to viral infection, with immune- regulating lipids, pro-in ammatory lipids, and lipid mediators plausibly modulating the immune response during COVID-19, as one example. The immune system  physiology is also reliant on its metabolic function, whether from  development, proliferation, activation, or memory perspective. Immunity is shaped and guided by humoral factors, which we address in the next section, as to the SARS-CoV- viral in uence on these factors and the effects on the body. HUMORAL ADAPTATIONS AND CHANGES Humoral factors are compounds that are transported by the circulatory system throughout the body, and include immune factors (.., cytokines, chemokines, antibodies, complement proteins, clotting factors, etc.), hormones, RNAs, lipids, metabo- lites, etc. These play  role in steady-state physiology as well as pathophysiological adaptations, with changes in humoral factors occurring from SARS-CoV- infection. One example is bradykinin,  peptide that is involved with physiological effects, including dilation of arterioles through release of prostacyclin, nitric oxide, and EDHF, constriction of veins by prostaglandin F2, as well as various biochemical effects including upregulation of intracellular Ca2+, regulation of cAMP/cGMP, arachidonic acid release, promotion of VEGF expression and angiogenesis, and activation of TGF-, JAK/STAT pathways [13]. Additionally, bradykinin is degraded by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and enhanced by angiotensin produced by ACE2.",

Additionally, bradykinin is degraded by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and enhanced by angiotensin produced by ACE2. Bradykinin, angiotensin, ACE, and ACE2, are all part of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which serves  role within the endocrine system in regulation of renal, cardiac, and vascular physiology, and in turn, systemic physiology [14]. Moreover, SARS-CoV- enters the cell through receptors such as ACE2 and NRP-, in  process requiring the transmembrane protease  (TMPRSS2) protein [, 15]; thus, SARS-CoV- directly .. Narayanan et al. 11 European Journal of Human Genetics (2024) 32:10\n\ninteracts with the RAS system and in uences its activity. Indeed, gene analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage  uid from COVID-19 patients showed  critical imbalance of RAS-related factors, including decreased expression of ACE, while increases in ACE2, renin, angiotensin, and bradykinin, which were suggestive of elevated bradykinin levels systemically that lead to the cardiovas- cular symptoms seen with patients [16]. Another study of the bradykinin cascade of COVID-19 patients correlated changes in this pathway with disease severity, showing accumulated bradykinin levels were related with patient disease severity, as well as with levels of in ammation, coagulation, and lymphopenia [17]. In addition to the RAS axis, the endocrine system is also vulnerable to SARS-CoV- infection [14, 15]. For example, the ACE2 receptor is expressed in endocrine glands, including the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, adrenals, pancreas, thyroid glands, ovaries, and testes [15]. Studies have shown reduced thyroid (.., subacute thyroiditis, thyrotoxicosis), adrenal (.., hypocortisolism, hyponatremia), hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (.., HPA dysfunc- tion, hypocortisolism, hypothyroidism), and pancreatic islet func- tion (.., hyperglycemia, pancreatic injury based from elevated amylase and lipase), as well as damage to the testes and changes with menstrual cycle being described in COVID-19 patients [14, 15]. SARS-CoV- infection has also been suggested to affect glycemic control, with an international registry having been organized to investigate the interaction between diabetes and COVID-19 [14]. Moreover, clinical studies show more severe outcomes in patients with diabetes, obesity, and hypertension; however, there is  lack of data in humans on ACE2 expression in pathological conditions with endocrine tissues, an area which needs future investigation [15]. Various mouse studies have enabled us to investigate organ-speci  adaptations, including examining the effects of ACE2 deletion in endocrine organs and observing the bene cial effects of ACE2 gene therapy [15]. The details of these studies are outside the scope of this review, but are elaborated in ref. [14, 15]. As with bradykinin, the remodeling of endocrine factors results in changes with the factors that endocrine organs produce and secrete, though this is an area warrants more investigation. Indeed, these include the non-coding transcriptome, genes which are not involved with protein synthesis, but are transcribed and often secreted into the circulation, in turn providing information on the genetic state of their originating cells, but also controlling and regulating biological adaptations due to the ability of the non-coding RNAs to interact with other macromolecules, including DNA, RNA, and proteins. We elaborate on the changes with the non-coding RNA transcriptome seen in COVID-19 patients in the next section. EXOSOMES INFLUENCE ON SARS-COV- INFECTION Exosomes are extracellular vesicles generated by all cells that carry cellular components, including nucleic acids, proteins, lipids, and metabolites. They are carried and transported in blood and lymph, and serve near- and long-distance intercellular communication and biological effects. They also serve as  biomarker based on their contents, which may be altered in different conditions and physiological states. It is known that during viral infection, extracellular vesicles become vectors of viral material. More recent reports have also highlighted this occurs with SARS-CoV- infection [18]. One study investigated and compared exosomes from mild or severe COVID-19 patients. The exosomes from both groups contained SARS-CoV- spike-derived peptides and immunomodu- latory molecules, though only those from mild patients could stimulate an antigen-speci  CD4 -cell response [19]. This study also observed that the proteome of exosomes of mild patients correlated with  normally functioning immune system, while that of severe patients was associated with increased and chronic in ammation. As mentioned above, exosomes may affect distant cells, and one study explored this connection in the context of COVID-19 by evaluating exosome effects on endothelial cells from exosomes derived from plasma [19]. Exosomes affected the endothelial cells by inducing in ammation-related pathways (.., NRLP3, caspase- , and interleukin--beta) through mRNA expression, compared with plasma from mild disease or healthy donors. The study showed that these adaptations were tied with exosomes contain- ing tenascin- and  brinogen-beta, which triggered the in am- matory pathways by inducing NF-kB mediated pathways. While this study focused on endothelial cell responses, it was noted that these effects may promote in ammation in other cell types systemically. Exosomes can also be involved with the in ammatory response. subset of exosomes, called defensosomes, mediate host defense by binding and inhibiting pathogenic responses. study showed that exosomes in SARS-CoV--infected patients can also be involved in this capacity by interfering with surface protein interactions [20]. Exosomes containing high levels of the viral receptor, ACE2, were induced from SARS-CoV- infection and activation of viral sensors in cell culture utilizing the autophagy protein, ATG16L1, and were shown to be able to bind and block viral entry. These  ndings support that exosomes may also be involved with the SARS-CoV- antiviral response, with more research of this area increasing our understanding of exosomes and their role in host defense mechanisms. Finally, exosomes may provide insight into organ adaptations based on exosomes from the source organ, in general as well as in speci  circumstances such as from viral infection. The exosomes produced from speci  cells will communicate their cellular phenotypic state, with each exosome sharing the identity of its source cell. In turn, organ-speci  adaptations from SARS-CoV- infection may be able to be delineated through measurement of exosomes. One study explored this by investigating how SARS- CoV- is known to invade neural cell mitochondria, with SARS- CoV- proteins and mitochondrial proteins contained within neuron- and astrocyte-derived exosomes quanti ed in post COVID-19 infection. Indeed, these exosomes contained SARS- CoV-  and S1 proteins and varied depending on the context of the disease severity and timeline of COVID-19 [21]. This study is one example of the utility exosomes may provide for complex, multi-organ conditions like COVID-19, in studying and determin- ing physiological alterations resulting from the disease condition. ROLES OF THE NON-CODING TRANSCRIPTOME IN SARS-COV- INFECTION RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV- are  exible in their ability to circumvent cellular defenses through  variety of mechanisms that often involve speci  interactions with cellular components. Additionally, some viral genomes can also be processed by cellular machinery to generate non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that could have regulatory functions. Among them, speci  elements of the host ncRNA transcriptome include microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and circular RNAs (circRNAs), have been described as important players in the regulation of the viral replicative cycle and the cellular antiviral responses (Fig. ). To summarize the current knowledge about ncRNAs and SARS-CoV-, we share the latest details of the different ncRNA families and their regulatory roles during infection and disease progression. MIRNAS We begin with highlighting microRNAs (miRNAs), which are short regulatory non-coding RNAs generated by the enzymatic proces- sing of speci  RNA transcripts. Their regulatory functions at the cellular level are exerted by recruiting regulatory proteins (RNA- induced silencing complex, or RISC) which are further targeted to .. Narayanan et al. 12 European Journal of Human Genetics (2024) 32:10\n\nthe  -UTR of mRNAs by base complementarity, causing  repressive effect on gene expression [22]. Considering the possible involvement of dysregulated miRNAs upon infection on the systemic manifestations of COVID-19, multiple research groups pro led circulating miRNA levels in SARS-CoV- patients. One study of  strati ed cohort of COVID-19 patients showed  molecular signature composed of three blood-circulating miRNAs (hsa-miR-423-5p, hsa-miR-23a-3p and hsa-miR-195-5p), indepen- dently classi ed COVID-19 cases, distinguishing them from other viral infections such as H1N1 in uenza and healthy controls [23]. Recently  circulating miRNA, hsa-miR-2392, was shown and suggested to be one of the main drivers of  suppressive effect of mitochondrial gene expression and in ammation effectors, promoting many of the described symptoms associated with COVID-19. This miRNA was also detected in SARS-CoV--infected patient serum and urine, opening the possibility of its use as  prognostic biomarker for the disease [24]. Mitochondrial analysis showed miR-2392 targets were OXPHOS, mitochondrial transla- tion, and mitochondrial metabolism related transcripts. In summary, SARS-CoV- elevates miRNAs, such as miR-2392, which can result in affecting biochemical pathways (.., downregulation of OXPHOS), and treatment with anti-miR-2393 therapeutics potentially blocks SARS-CoV- infection in hamsters and hACE2- A549 cells [24]. Several additional miRNA  have also been observed to be involved with COVID-19 outcomes (.., level of viral load, biomarkers, etc.), as well as having various biochemical roles (.., viral entry, cytokine storm development, activation of signaling pathways, etc.). These include miRNA interaction with cell death processes, regulating pathways such as p53 by miR-101, miR-100, miR-, miR-107, etc., as well with the viral entry process (.., hsa-miR-98-5p binding to TMPRSS2 transcript). Additionally, cellular in ammation processes in COVID-19 infected individuals are affected by miRNA  (.., miR-146a, miR-21, and miR-142), by promoting MAPK and NF-kB signaling causing cellular pro- in ammatory phenotypic adaptations, which has additional consequences such as mitochondrial stress from production of in ammatory factors and reactive oxygen species. These highlight the signi cant and diverse roles miRNA  play in steady-state physiology and viral infection induced pathophysiology in COVID- 19, which here we brie  describe, but are covered in more detail in the following review [25]. LNCRNAS Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are  wide family of non-coding transcripts characterized by their lack of coding potential, their larger sizes when compared to other ncRNAs (more than 200 nucleotides), and their origin from devoted transcriptional units. Functionally, lncRNAs can regulate the dynamics of the genomic output from chromatin to the cytoplasm, mainly by acting as molecular scaffolds of biological complexes that establish inter- actions with proteins, DNA, and other RNA molecules. Early transcriptomic studies using cell models show SARS-CoV- infection induces  transcriptional pattern that produces several differentially expressed lncRNAs [26]. Through co-expression network analysis, another study identi ed four differentially expressed lncRNAs correlating with genes involved in various immune-related pathways, suggesting that the aberrant expres- sion of these four lncRNAs can be associated with SARS-CoV- Fig. Different RNA and their role in COVID-19.

Interestingly, NRIR and BISPR lncRNAs were also upregulated in the blood of COVID-19 patients as reported in the COVIDOME project [30], suggesting possible involvement in the systemic manifestations of the viral infection. CIRCRNAS Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA molecules generated by non-canonical back-splicing events from coding and non-coding transcripts. Several studies on the role of circRNAs in viral infections, such as SARS-CoV-, have been published recently; however reports showing the involvement and function of circRNAs with SARS-CoV- infection are few and need to be considered with caution due to the limited number of samples and the intrinsic characteristics of the infection models. In one example,  lung epithelial cell model infected with SARS-CoV- showed differential circRNA expression upon infection. Analyzing these circRNA parental genes revealed they were involved with in ammation and immune responses [31]. CircRNAs related to SARS-CoV- infection have also been shown to be detectable in the peripheral blood circulation, highlighting their potential as COVID-19 biomarkers [32]. In this section, we describe humoral factors (and in the previous, metabolism related components) involved in steady-state physiol- ogy and responding to SARS-CoV- infection in COVID-19 patients, with these intrinsically affecting organ structure and function, and extrinsically affecting systemic physiology based on their produc- tion, secretion, and distribution through the circulatory system (Fig. ). The circulatory system, part of the cardiovascular system, in of itself adapts to SARS-CoV- infection, which we will describe in the next section. CARDIOVASCULAR ADAPTATIONS AND CHANGES The cardiovascular system includes the heart, arteries, veins, capillaries, and lymphatics, which are the organ systems responsible for the transport of blood, lymph, and their constituents to every organ in the body. Blood and lymph transport multiple components, including water, red blood cells, white blood cells, macromolecules (.., lipids, proteins, carbohy- drates, macromolecule, etc.), micromolecules (.., nutrients, ions, etc.), of which are circulated systemically and transported to and from all organs of the body. Included in the transport of these components by blood and lymph are pathogens, such as the SARS-CoV- virus, which bene ts from the cardiovascular system not only by binding to  cell-type expressing its cognate receptor (.., endothelial cells and ACE2 receptor), but also from the cardiovascular system  function in transporting the virus and its Fig. SARS-CoV- Intracellular Replication and Extracellular Release of Circulating Factors.

In turn, the COVID-19 cardiovascular-related symptoms vary greatly, ranging from asymptomatic or mild respiratory symptoms to severe life-threatening respiratory and cardiac failure [33]. Early reports have described common symptoms of COVID-19 to include fever (88%), fatigue (38%), chills (11%), headache (14%), nasal congestion (%), sore throat (14%), dry cough (68%), dyspnea (19%), nausea/emesis (%), diarrhea ( 14%), and myalgias (15%). meta-analysis of eight studies showed  higher prevalence of hypertension (17   %) and diabetes mellitus (   %) followed by cardiovascular disease (   %) in COVID-19 patients [33, 34]. Moreover, concomitant cardiovascular (CV) conditions may be occurring in  25% of COVID-19 infected population and an even greater proportion of those who die from the disease [33]. Indeed, evidence suggests that among the primary causes of death and overall mortality from COVID-19 infection are cardiac issues and respiratory failure [34]. These symptoms result from changes occurring at the molecular level from SARS-CoV- infection. large autopsy study investigating multiple organs (heart, lung, kidney, liver, and lymph nodes) showed that the cellular and functional gene signatures from each organ  major cell types (.., cardiomyocytes in the heart) decrease as  function of the viral load. More speci cally in the heart ( = 41 from patient autopsy samples), despite no histological change, many heart functional markers (.., TNNI3, TNNT2, MYBPC3, PLN, and HAND1) showed decreased levels resulting from COVID-19 infection [35]. Another study showed the presence of SARS-CoV- in the myocardial heart tissue from autopsy cases, suggested to be tied to myocardial injury [36]. Indeed, these cellular adaptations extend into the vascular system (.., arteries, veins, etc.), with histopathological evidence from autopsy studies showing direct viral infection of endothelial cells and micro- and macrovascular thrombosis occurring in both the arterial and venous circulations. An autopsy study investigating COVID-19 in three patients showed SARS-CoV- viral components present in the endothelial cells from different autopsied organs, including the kidney, lung, heart, and liver were each infected with SARS-CoV- [37]. In ammation of the endothelium was also observed, along with recruitment of neutrophils and mononuclear cells to the site of damage. In vitro studies also support SARS-CoV-  being able to directly infect cardiovascular cells as seen from experiments showing viral infection of engineered human blood vessel organoids [38]. Severe COVID-19 has also been associated with endothelial speci  changes and effects such as elevated endothelial activation, hypercoagulability, and increased presence of von Willebrand Factor [39, 40]. Endotheliitis from COVID-19 can occur, leading to  loss of cell cell junctions, loss of endothelial cells, exposure of the basement membrane, abnormal cytokine release, abnormal reactive oxygen species release, and intussusceptive angiogenesis. Endothelin- has been suggested as  possible biomarker for those at risk with COVID-19 [34]. These cardiovascular adaptations from SARS-CoV- infection lead to  number of pathophysiological consequences including hypoxia, with prolonged ischemia leading to formation of hypoxanthine as an ATP breakdown product [36]. These effects may be from tissue remodeling caused by viral infection, as well as changes in blood viscosity, clotting, or in ammation, though more research of these areas would bene  our understanding of the effects of SARS-CoV- on the cardiovascular system and organ remodeling [33, 34, 36]. For example,  meta-analysis showed there are diverse cardiovascular complications including cardiac injury (.., myocardial injury, microinfarcts), heart failure, micro- embolic infarcts, acute coronary syndrome, arrhythmia, hyperten- sion, and atrial and ventricular complications (..,  brosis) [33, 34]. Autopsy and case reports from COVID-19 patients are also varied in their observations of cardiac tissue changes, highlighting the complexity of the disease and individual differences in uencing pathophysiological progression and outcomes. Identifying cardiovascular speci  biomarkers would help evaluate, as well as measure progression of disease, with troponin  as one example of  clinical marker evaluating myocardial injury is troponin . Troponin  has been shown to be elevated in >10% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, increasing with disease severity [41]. Identifying more markers with cardiovascular speci  outcomes (.. metabolites, lipids, humoral factors, etc., mentioned in the above sections) would help evaluate, correlate, and triage patients and improve their outcomes, as well as facilitate identi cation of speci  biochemical pathways that may mechanistically explain disease symptoms. Indeed, with the metabolic and physiological adaptations seen with COVID-19 patients, understanding mitochondrial adaptations in these contexts is relevant, given mitochondrial function in bioenergetics. As discussed in our  rst review, the mitochondria is heavily dysregulated and suppressed in the host during SARS-CoV- infection []. One study speci cally analyzed tran- scriptomic data on heart samples collected from deceased COVID- 19 patients []. This analysis showed heavy suppression at the transcript level of the majority of mitochondrial pathways and genes []. The non-coding transcriptome response to SARS-CoV- may also play  signi cant response and regulatory role with the cardiovascular adaptations developing from COVID-19 disease. Whether miRNA  (.., hsa-miR-2392), lncRNA  (.., NRIR and BISPR), or circRNA  that are involved in suppressing mitochondrial gene expression, changing oxidative phosphorylation, mitochon- drial structure (.., translation, metabolism, etc.), and causing in ammatory effects, may be involved with local cardiac adapta- tions or systemic vascular adaptations is unknown, but warrants future investigations to explore the speci  roles of the transcriptome with cardiovascular adaptations. Furthermore, given the changes in cardiovascular structure, function, biochemical adaptations, that occur from SARS-CoV- infection, further study of cardiovascular mitochondrial adaptations is of relevance, and would help elucidate the underlying mechanisms impacting the cardiovascular system resultant from SARS-CoV- infection. IMMUNE ADAPTATIONS AND CHANGES The immune system includes the innate and adaptive immune systems. The innate system involves nonspeci  responses to injury, and includes cell populations such as monocytes, macro- phages, neutrophils, basophils, eosinophils, etc. The adaptive immune system involves speci  response to pathogen infection, and includes cell populations such as  and  cells. The two arms of the immune system communicate, interact, and support each other in responding to injury, aided by humoral, circulating factors such as cytokines and chemokines, that provide information and context to immune cells as to how, where, and what to respond to, as well as the magnitude of the response. In turn, there are various feedback loops that provide guidance and direction to the immune system, both innate and adaptive, with SARS-CoV- activating both the innate and adaptive immune systems. For the innate immune system, activation appears to be guided by neutrophils, which display increased levels of ROS and activated NETosis [42]. Additionally, the loss of ACE2 and DABK in the lungs of patients encourages neutrophil in ltration and in ammation. SARS-CoV- has also been suggested to dysregulate type  interferon signaling, which contributes to immune evasion early in infection. Consistent with this  nding, bulk analysis of whole blood cell transcriptomes of severe COVID-19 patients compared with non-critically ill COVID-19 patients showed upregulation of Interferon alpha as the primary contributor to severe COVID-19. Activated monocytes and macrophages also migrate to the lungs (chemotaxis), further exacerbating lung in ammation and pulmonary  brosis [43]. Several studies have reported disordered structure of the infected lung, along with extensive immune in ltration [35, 44]. For example, the lung ..

Another study of COVID-19 patients showed chronic lung impairment accompanied by persistent respiratory immune alterations, showing speci  memory  and  cells enriched at the site of infection [45]. With the signi cant neutrophil, macrophage,  and  cell in ltration and activation observed, and localized hyperin ammatory states of these immune cells around alveolar epithelial cells, this develops into more lung damage and loss of compartmental identity. When  timeline and pattern of the cytokine storm in tracheal aspirate samples was organized and reported, divergences in the systemic versus airway cytokine production during COVID-19 were observed [46]. Indeed,  study assessing lung function of critical COVID-19 patients showed 55% of them experienced persistent impairment three months after ICU discharge, including declines in patient lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life [47].",

Indeed,  study assessing lung function of critical COVID-19 patients showed 55% of them experienced persistent impairment three months after ICU discharge, including declines in patient lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life [47]. This suggests respiratory failure is another signi cant factor involved with patient mortality with severe SARS-CoV- infection, with an investigation of single-nuclei RNA sequencing of COVID- 19 patient lung samples identi ed substantial alterations in cellular composition, transcriptional cell states, and cell-to-cell interactions, with the data showing COVID-19 patient lungs were highly in amed, with dense in ltration of aberrantly activated macrophages, though with impaired -cell responses and suggestions of impaired lung regeneration, based on alveolar type  cell phenotypes [48]. With regard to adaptive immune cell responses to SARS-CoV-, these include lymphopenia (lowered CD4 and CD8 -cell number) in COVID-19 patients, also seen in autopsy reports [49, 50]. There are case by case variations; for example, an in ux of  cells and myeloid cells occurs into the myocardium. In response to this event, COVID-19  pathogen-associated molecular patterns and damage-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs and DAMPs) are activated, as well as cytokines released by alveolar macrophages [51, 52]. These pathways are thought to contribute to the dysregulation of monocytes and macrophages in COVID-19 [53] and the subsequent dysfunction of  cells. Changes also occur within the heart, as seen with gene expression analysis of cardiac tissue for TNF- , interferon- , chemokine ligand , interleukin-, interleukin- (CXCL8), and interleukin-18. Severe COVID-19 is also associated with elevated endothelial activation, hypercoagulabil- ity, and the presence of von Willebrand Factor (vWF) [53, 54]. Indeed, COVID-19 induces  complex pattern of cytokine release as part of an overall dysregulated immune response that, in severe cases, injures the parenchyma of vital organs and leads to viremia and sepsis [55, 56]. Severe COVID-19 is characterized by an in ammatory pro le that involves initial immune evasion by downregulation of Type  Interferon pathways along with signi cant upregulation of IL-, IL- and TNF-  in the lungs that coincides with increased NF-  activity [57, 58]. In one study of COVID-19 patients,  notable increase in multiple serum cytokines (.., TNF- , IFN- , IL-, IL-, IL- and IL-10) was seen [59], while another study showed high plasma levels of IL- , IL-1RA, IL-, IL-, IL-, IL-10, bFGF, GCSF, GM-CSF, IFN- , IP-10, MCP1, MIP- , MIP- , PDGF, TNF- , and VEGF. different study showed increased levels of in ammatory markers such as -reactive protein, -dimer, ferritin, IL- and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) associated with higher mortality in COVID-19 patients [60]. These results suggest an overproduction of cytokines in response to lung damage, or as  compensatory response to attempt to re-direct, accelerate, or shutdown the immune response. These cytokine  uctuations also coincide with systemic in ammation and myocardial injury; in 137 patients admitted for COVID-19 disease in Hubei province, heart palpita- tions were noted as one of the presenting symptoms in .% of patients [61]. Moreover, there have been reports of complete heart blockage and atrial  brillation in patients with COVID-19 infection [62]. In patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19, increased levels of pro-in ammatory cytokines, (.., soluble IL-2R, IL-, IL-, and TNF- ) have been observed, with these cytokines disrupting endothelial cells antithrombotic and anti- in ammatory functions, leading to coagulation dysregulation, complement and platelet activation, and leukocyte recruitment in the microvasculature [63, 64]. While increased levels of circulating chemokines, pro-in ammatory cytokines, regulatory cytokines, and growth factors were observed in severe COVID patients who died as compared to surviving patients,  more restricted and selective increase of cytokines such as IL-10 was observed in the airway samples with actual decreased levels of pro-in ammatory cytokines such as IFN- , IL-17, IL-, and IL- as compared to uninfected controls [46]. These results demonstrate that in am- mation is also highly modulated in the airways as an attempt to decrease exacerbated in ammation. Figure  illustrates  snapshot of extracellular factors involved with immune adaptations during COVID-19 and the uniqueness of systemic versus airway in ammatory milieu. ORGAN ALTERATIONS FROM SARS-COV- INFECTION In addition to the cardiovascular system, SARS-CoV- infects and has an effect on many organ systems (.., cardiovascular, immune, and endocrine systems, as described above), including the lungs, lymph nodes, brain, liver, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, testis (Fig. ) [65 67]. COVID-19 is known to cause multi-organ dysfunction, though the burden of infection outside the respiratory tract and time to viral clearance is not well understood. recent postmortem study of 44 patients quanti ed and mapped the distribution, replication, and cell-type speci city of SARS-CoV- across the body, speci cally the brain but other organs as well, from acute infection to more than seven months following symptom onset. It was seen that SARS-CoV- infection of the body was widely spread across respiratory and non-respiratory tissues (.., the brain) [68]. This spread of infection provides context for the different symptoms patients experience. Neurological and psychiatric symptoms have been reported for acute, post-acute, and longer-term SARS-CoV- infection in human patients across the human lifespan [69]. Although neurological manifestations remain incompletely characterized in terms of etiology, severity, and incidence, they present signs of nonspeci  (.., headache, dizziness, myalgia, fatigue, somnolence, insomnia, etc.) and speci  (.., encephalopathy, encephalitis, stroke, status epilepticus, ataxia, anosmia, ageusia, demyelinating syndromes, etc.) de cits of the central nervous system, the peripheral nervous system, or both, with new-onset or relapsed associated prodromal, subthreshold, or fully expressed (.., suprathreshold) psychiatric conditions. The spectrum of presumed virogenic psychiatric disorders across age cohorts and other demographic classi ca- tions is broad and includes anxiety, depression, confusion or disordered thought (.., brain fogor psychosis). Structural and functional changes in brain anatomy, such as brief to protracted alterations in gray and white matter volume, blood perfusion and oxygenation, and metabolic activity [70], often parallel and are consistent with onset and duration of mental health diagnoses in infected populations. Areas caudal to the neocortex tend to be most affected, with olfactory cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum, and brain stem abnormalities occurring in greater frequency and magnitude in COVID-19 patients. Uncer- tainty regarding the cause of COVID-19-related neuropathology centers on SARS-CoV- neuroinvasion, with the olfactory epithe- lium as  plausible entry point with subsequent retrograde transsynaptic propagation to other brain areas. Astrocytes and Schwann cells infected by SARS-CoV- may also be negatively impacted with their neurotransmission, synapse modulation, reinnervation, metabolite and electrolyte home- ostasis, and cell signaling functions. This may cause, contribute, .. Narayanan et al. 16 European Journal of Human Genetics (2024) 32:10\n\nor lead to observed central and peripheral nervous system trauma and dysfunction [70]. There is data that also supports hemato- genous mechanisms enabling viral access to nervous tissue through infection of blood-brain-barrier (BBB) endothelial cells or epithelial cells of the choroid plexus blood CSF barrier. Indeed,  study examining SARS-CoV- interaction with brain organoids suggests  compromised blood-brain-barrier (BBB) as manifested by injured endothelial cells and increased BBB permeability [71]. Multisystem hyperin ammatory immunoreactions most appropri- ately describe for the diverse set of pathologies observed in post mortem autopsy analyses, as well as in live in vivo or in vitro tissue, the result of hemorrhagic, ischemic, and hypoxic injury, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuronal damage and apoptosis, and microglial and astrocytic activation. With regard to gastrointestinal (GI) effects of SARS-CoV-, an autopsy study of 29 cases showed the GI to be one of the primary organs infected by the virus, as well as being supported by the literature of postmortem organ analysis [65]. GI involvement and symptoms (.., diarrhea, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, abdominal pain, etc.) is associated with long hospital stays and severity of disease, with the rates of GI symptoms of the percent of individuals ranging from 11% to 53%. ACE2 is frequently found in human intestinal epithelial cells, with SARS-CoV- being detected in patient GI samples [72]. Indeed, while there is  paucity of data of SARS-CoV- effects on GI physiology, GI symptoms are common in patients with COVID-19, though and should be considered when evaluating patient conditions as well as treatment options. Here we summarize  few examples of organ adaptations resulting from SARS-CoV- infection. These highlight the virus  diverse biological targets and outcomes, though more studies are warranted given our comprehensive lack of understanding of these, and other, organ alterations, as well in particular, the biochemical pathways that are affected by viral infection. In addressing these knowledge gaps, patient care will improve as well as new treatment modalities will be identi ed. Moreover, these adaptations are related with long-term implications of SARS- CoV- infection, of which we describe in the next section. IMPACT OF CIRCULATING FACTORS ON POST-ACUTE SEQUELAE OF SARS-COV- (PASC, LONG COVID-19) In addition to COVID-19 from SARS-CoV- infection, patients may experience long-term symptoms as  result of organ or tissue damage due to SARS-CoV-. This condition is referred to as post- acute sequelae of SARS-CoV- (PASC), or long COVID-19 [73, 74]. PASC patients are burdened with multiple symptoms, including more than  third of PASC patients continuing to experience lung  brotic abnormalities following hospital discharge [75]. Many are also at risk of developing microemboli due to maladaptations with clotting physiology (.., massively increased levels of vWF which leads to increased platelet activation, etc.) [76]. Indeed, virus- driven cellular alterations have been suggested to contribute to the pathophysiology of PASC patients [, 77]. Persistent viral presence and in ammation within the olfactory epithelium has been evident from histological analysis, as well as long-term impairments in taste and smell in the cells of the tongue  taste buds [78]. PASC is also characterized by chronic fatigue, which has numerous underlying causes. As  comparison, the post-  or fever fatigue that occurs (.., Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS)) may have some similarities to the persistent fatigue in PASC. PASC symptoms may also be in uenced by abnormalities of the central nervous system, such as brain hypometabolism [79]. recent postmortem study also quanti ed and mapped the SARS-CoV- organ tropism,  nding long-term signs of infection in the brain, as well as across the body within the tissue (.., respiratory, cardiovascular, lymphoid, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, endocrine, skin, and peripheral nervous systems) seven months following infection onset, con rmed through in situ hybridization, immunohistochemistry, and immuno uorescence analyses of the tissue, isolation of SARS- CoV- from tissue by cell culture, and detection of the spike sequence variants in non-respiratory sites [71]. While psychologi- cal and environmental factors are likely to be involved, long-term biochemical adaptations, including increased oxidative stress and muscle mitochondrial failure, may contribute to the chronic fatigue syndrome found in PASC patients [80].

The severity of the primary infection appears to be independent from the possibility and severity of long- term symptoms, though this requires further research. Indeed, it is critical to understand the systemic effects of PASC, its biological mechanism and symptoms, and to develop treatments that promote functional recovery in symptomatic individuals, given the negative health-effects of PASC, as well as the socioeconomic and healthcare burden this condition will impose. Further research on PASC will improve our knowledge and understanding of the condition, as well as enable identi cation of relevant treatments and interventions to improve patient outcomes. CONCLUSION SARS-CoV- and its resultant acute and chronic diseases, COVID-19 and PASC, have caused signi cant impacts worldwide. Here we describe and review the latest knowledge about the viral effect on our physiology, as well as the latest research on relevant whole- body metabolism pathways, circulating biological components (.., RNA, cytokine, hormones, etc.), and affected organ systems and their physiological adaptations consequent to SARS-CoV- infection. COVID-19 is  pleiotropic, complex, and dynamic condition (Fig. ). The viral insults and cellular adaptations differ depending on the context, from cellular to organ systems, and intricate biochemistry ties and integrates these systems together. Herein, we have attempted to capture the prevalent host responses, as well as highlight gaps of knowledge that could be addressed with future research. We have also touched on relevant biochemical targets with potential for mitigating COVID-19 in the human host, and we will describe current and in-development treatment modalities that affect these in Part  of our review.

Mutations in and loss of DGC proteins cause  spectrum of muscular dystrophies. When only the sarcoglycan subcomplex is absent, muscles display severe myofiber degeneration, but little susceptibility to contractile damage, suggesting that disease occurs not by structural deficits but through aberrant signaling, namely, loss of normal mechanotransduction signaling through the sarcoglycan complex. We extended our previous studies on mechanosensitive,  -sarcoglycan-dependent ERK1/ phosphorylation, to determine whether additional pathways are altered with the loss of  -sarcoglycan. Methods: We examined mechanotransduction in the presence and absence of  -sarcoglycan, using C2C12 myotubes, and primary cultures and isolated muscles from C57Bl/ (C57) and  -sarcoglycan-null ( -SG-/-) mice. All were subjected to cyclic passive stretch. Signaling protein phosphorylation was determined by immunoblotting of lysates from stretched and non-stretched samples. Calcium dependence was assessed by maintaining muscles in calcium-free or tetracaine-supplemented Ringer  solution. Dependence on mTOR was determined by stretching isolated muscles in the presence or absence of rapamycin. Results: C2C12 myotube stretch caused  robust increase in -p70S6K, but decreased -FAK and -ERK2. Neither Akt nor ERK1 were responsive to passive stretch. Similar but non-significant trends were observed in C57 primary cultures in response to stretch, and  -SG-/- cultures displayed no p70S6K response. In contrast, in isolated muscles, p70S6K was mechanically responsive. Basal p70S6K activation was elevated in muscles of  -SG-/- mice, in  calcium-independent manner. p70S6K activation increased with stretch in both C57 and  -SG-/- isolated muscles, and was sustained in  -SG-/- muscles, unlike the transient response in C57 muscles. Rapamycin treatment blocked all of p70S6K activation in stretched C57 muscles, and reduced downstream S6RP phosphorylation. However, even though rapamycin treatment decreased p70S6K activation in stretched  -SG-/- muscles, S6RP phosphorylation remained elevated. Conclusions: p70S6K is an important component of  -sarcoglycan-dependent mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle. Our results suggest that loss of  -sarcoglycan uncouples the response of p70S6K to stretch and implies that  -sarcoglycan is important for inactivation of this pathway. Overall, we assert that altered load-sensing mechanisms exist in muscular dystrophies where the sarcoglycans are absent.

Skeletal Muscle 2014, :13\n\nBackground The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) is found at the sarcolemma of skeletal, cardiac, and smooth muscle cells, where it physically links the extracellular matrix (ECM) with the intracellular cytoskeleton, providing struc- tural support [-]. Mutations in DGC components cause different types of muscular dystrophy; for example, muta- tions in dystrophin cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), while mutations in  -,  -,  -, or  -sarcoglycan (SG) cause limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) [-]. When dystrophin is mutated in DMD or in the mdx mouse model of DMD, the entire DGC is substantially reduced at the sarcolemma. In contrast, when any one of the SGs is mutated, in LGMD or any of the SG knock-out mice, the other three SGs are either absent or reduced at the sarcolemma, but the rest of the DGC remains, includ- ing the link formed by dystrophin and dystroglycan be- tween the ECM and the cytoskeleton [,,,]. Unlike the skeletal muscles of the mdx mouse, muscles of the  -SG knock-out ( -SG-/-) mouse display no mechanical fragility, at least until  months of age, as shown by  minimal loss of force-generating capacity following  series of eccentric contractions (ECCs) [,]. In spite of this, the  -SG-/- mouse exhibits  severe dystrophic phenotype on histo- logical examination, with extensive myofiber degeneration and regeneration, fibrosis, and disruption of sarcolemmal integrity, similar to the mdx mouse []. The lack of mechanical fragility suggests that aberrant signaling may contribute to the muscle degeneration seen in the  -SG-/- mouse. Indeed, our previous studies demon- strated that localization of the SG complex to the sarco- lemma and phosphorylation of the tyrosine  residue of  -SG are essential for normal signaling by extracellular signal-regulated kinases  and  (ERK1/), in response to ECCs [10,11]. Based upon these data, we have asserted that the SG complex acts as  mechanosensor in skeletal muscle because of its position within the DGC, the modifications that occur to  -SG with mech- anical perturbation, and the necessity of the complex for normal signaling. complication of using ECCs to invoke signal transduc- tion is that there are multiple processes in play. Not only is there externally applied tension on the sarcolemma and DGC as  result of lengthening, but also active contraction resulting in internally applied tension and Ca2+ flux within the fibers and across the sarcolemma, all of which could contribute to alterations in signaling in the absence of  -SG. Calcium is known to be involved in many mechano- sensitive signaling pathways (reviewed in [12,13]) and aber- rant calcium regulation is  feature of SG-deficient muscle [14-22]. Indeed, an exaggerated ERK1/ response to mech- anical stimulation that is dependent on extracellular cal- cium has been demonstrated in the mdx mouse diaphragm [23]. Studies suggest that aberrant calcium regulation in the muscular dystrophies results from abnormal levels and activity of the mechanosensitive TRP channels and/or mis- regulation of store operated calcium entry via the STIM1 and Orai1 channels [24-29]. Direct disruption of the sarco- lemma, for which there is evidence in SG-null animal models [,,30,31], could also contribute to loss of calcium homeostasis. Furthermore, several strategies to improve Ca2+ handling are known to counteract the pathology as- sociated with the muscular dystrophies [25,32-34]. There- fore, identification of mechanosensitive signaling that is attributable to the SG complex rather than other pro- cesses occurring during mechanical perturbation has been challenging. One pathway of interest involves p70S6K, which is ca- nonically activated in response to mitogens via the phos- phoinositide -kinase (PI3K) pathway (reviewed in [35]) and is known to respond to mechanical load [36]. Acti- vation of p70S6K involves  hierarchical series of phos- phorylation events, beginning with phosphorylation of multiple sites in the -terminal autoinhibitory domain, followed by mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)- dependent phosphorylation of sites in the linker region, which allows for full activation of the kinase via phos- phorylation of threonine 229 (T229) in the catalytic do- main by phosphoinositide-dependent kinase  (PDK1) (reviewed in [37]). Although phosphorylation of T229 is required for p70S6K activation, phosphorylation of T389 in the linker region has been found to correlate most closely with in vivo activity [38], and can be used as  measure of kinase activation. p70S6K has  multitude of downstream targets, with roles in protein synthesis, growth, proliferation, survival, and more [35], including S6 ribosomal protein (S6RP), which closely correlates with protein translation rates [39]. In the current study, we examined ERK1/, Akt, focal adhesion kinase (FAK), and p70S6K responses to passive stretch in C57 and  -SG-/- skeletal muscle to further eluci- date the importance of the SG complex for mechanotrans- duction. While differences in ERK1/ phosphorylation between C57 and  -SG-/- muscle were calcium-dependent, differences in p70S6K activation were independent of cal- cium. In addition, the p70S6K response to stretch in both primary myofiber cultures and isolated extensor digitorum longus (EDL) muscles was differentially regulated in the absence of  -SG. Specifically, experiments in isolated muscles suggest that  -SG is required for inactivation of p70S6K. The findings increase our understanding of the contribution of aberrant load-sensing to the pathology of muscular dystrophies where the SG complex is deficient. Methods Animals Adult C57BL/ (C57) and  -SG-null ( -SG-/-) mice were used. For ex vivo protocols, mice were aged  to 16 weeks. Moorwood et al.

All experiments were approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. C2C12 myotube culture Flexible silicone membranes (Specialty Manufacturing, Inc.) were stretched across the bottom of custom cylinders which acted as  culture chamber. The membranes were held in place using an -ring as described previously [40]. Membranes were then coated with  thin layer of  mg/mL GFR Matrigel (BD #354230). C2C12 myoblasts (. 105/ cylinder) were seeded onto the membranes and maintained at % CO2 at 37  in growth media (10% FBS, 100  penicillin, 100   streptomycin, 100  /mL gentamycin in DMEM) for approximately 24  until 70% to 80% confluent, then switched to differentiation media (% HS, 100  penicillin, 100   streptomycin, 100  /mL Gentamycin in DMEM). Myoblasts were allowed to differentiate into multinucleated myotubes for  days, during which media was changed every other day before stretching as described below. Primary myoblast culture Mice were euthanized using CO2 inhalation. Flexor digi- torum brevis (FDB) muscles were dissected and incu- bated with  mg/mL collagenase  (Sigma), 10% FBS in Tyrode  solution (125 mM NaCl,  mM KCl,  mM CaCl2,  mM MgCl2,  mM KH2PO4, 20 mM HEPES (all from Fisher), . mM glucose (Sigma), pH .) for 90 min at 37 , with shaking, as previously described [41]. Muscles were washed in 10% FBS in Tyrode  solu- tion and clumps of fibers were liberated by pipetting up and down in 10% FBS, 100  penicillin, 100   strepto- mycin in Tyrode  solution using  wide-mouthed glass pipette. Clumps of fibers were transferred to  second dish with the same solution and pipetted up and down again. Single fibers were transferred to  third dish be- fore plating on silicone membranes coated with Matrigel (Becton Dickinson;  mg/mL diluted in DMEM). Growth media (20% FBS, 10 ng/mL mouse basic fibroblast growth factor (MP Bio), 100  penicillin, 100   streptomycin,   /mL Fungizone, 100  /mL Gentamycin in Ham  -10 media) was carefully added and cultures were incu- bated without disturbance for  days at 37 . Media was then changed every  days. After  to 10 days, when myo- blast cultures were 70% to 80% confluent, media was switched to differentiation media (10% HS, .% chicken embryo extract, 100  penicillin, 100   streptomycin,   /mL Fungizone, 100  /mL Gentamycin in DMEM) and myoblasts were allowed to differentiate into multinu- cleated myotubes for  days before stretching as described below. Unless otherwise indicated, all cell culture reagents were purchased from Gibco. Myotube stretching protocol C2C12 myotubes were stretched using an apparatus that produces isotropic two-dimensional strain of cells in vitro, as described previously [40]. Briefly, myotubes were sub- jected to 10% strain, 40 times per minute, for 30 min, at 37  in  humidified atmosphere of % CO2 in air. Control myotubes were treated identically but were not stretched. Lysates were harvested immediately as described below. Primary myotubes were stretched using the protocol described for C2C12 myotubes. Stretched myotubes were then incubated without stretch for  further , , or   at 37  before harvesting lysates for immunoblotting as described below. Control (non-stretched) myotubes were harvested immediately after the end of the stretching protocol used for the stretched myotubes. Isolated muscle stretching protocol Mice were anaesthetized using ketamine and xylazine. EDL muscles were dissected and placed in an organ bath containing oxygenated high-glucose (25 mM) DMEM with HEPES (25 mM) (Life Technologies), at room temperature. For rapamycin sensitivity experiments, high-glucose DMEM was supplemented with 150 nM rapamycin (Sigma) or ve- hicle only (.% DMSO). Muscles were adjusted to . mN of resting tension, approximately equivalent to optimal length, based on our previous experiments [42].",

Band intensities were quantified using ImageQuant TL, 1D gel analysis (C2C12 and myo- tube cultures, rapamycin sensitivity experiments) or ImageJ (NIH) (all other isolated muscles). -p70S6K and -S6RP were normalized to either GAPDH or tubulin, -FAK was normalized to either -FAK or GAPDH, -Akt was normal- ized to -Akt, and -ERK1/ was normalized to -ERK1/. Microscopy Images of primary cultures were taken using  Leica DM RBE microscope and Leica DFC300 CCD camera, using OpenLab software (Perkin Elmer).

Results p70S6K, but not ERK1/ or Akt responds to passive stretch in vitro Studies using whole muscles from animal models of the dystrophies are made more complex by the presence of multiple cell types, as well as pathological processes such as fibrosis. Therefore, we initially investigated mechano- transduction signaling in passively stretched C2C12 myotubes. We found that passive stretching in vitro did not alter phosphorylation of ERK1 or Akt and that ERK2 and FAK phosphorylation decreased following stretch (Figure 1A,-,-). However, we found an increase in p70S6K phosphorylation at T389, which reflects activity, in response to passive stretching of C2C12 myotubes (Figure 1B,). Therefore, this in vitro model reflected some, but not all, stretch responses observed in muscle in vivo [43,44], and highlighted p70S6K as  pathway of interest. The lack of Akt phosphorylation suggests that p70S6K phosphorylation occurred through an Akt- independent pathway, while the lack of FAK phosphoryl- ation supports an integrin-independent mechanism. Differential p70S6K stretch response occurs in C57 and  -SG-/- primary cultures Having established pathways of interest in vitro using the C2C12 cell line, we used primary myoblast cultures from C57 and  -SG-/- mice (Figure 2A) to investigate the changes in mechanotransduction signaling associated solely with the loss of the SG complex in myofibers. C57 and  -SG-/- cultures were stretched for 30 min as de- scribed above and lysates were harvested , , or   after stretching ended, to allow observation of the signaling time course. Immunoblotting analysis showed that there was no difference in basal ERK1/ phosphorylation between C57 and  -SG-/- myotubes and little change in ERK1/ phosphorylation in response to stretch (Figure 2B, ,). Therefore, similar to the C2C12 cells, primary cultures did not reflect the ERK1/ phosphorylation responses found previously in C57 and  -SG-/- mice in vivo [10,11]. Neither -Akt nor -FAK displayed significant differences between C57 and  -SG-/- cultures Moorwood et al. Skeletal Muscle 2014, :13 Page  of 13\n\n(Figure 2B,,). Further, these proteins did not show any prolonged response to passive stretch in the primary cultures, consistent with the lack of an acute positive stretch response in C2C12 cells. Examination of p70S6K revealed  trend towards elevated T389 phos- phorylation at baseline in  -SG-/- myotubes, compared to C57 myotubes. Activation of p70S6K in  -SG-/- myo- tubes upon stretch was not apparent (Figure 2B,), but C57 myotubes displayed  trend for increased activation at  and   after stretching (Figure 2B,). Therefore, while the primary cultures reflect some of the responses found in C2C12 myotubes, the experimental system is too variable to draw firm conclusions regarding mech- anical signaling pathways associated with  -SG. Elevated -p70S6K in  -SG-/- muscles is calcium independent Our experiments in myotubes, together with our previ- ous studies in isolated muscles [10,11], suggested that ERK1/ phosphorylation changes require active contrac- tion in addition to stretch, whereas p70S6K responds to stretch alone. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we ex- tended our analysis to examine the response of p70S6K to passive stretch of isolated muscles. -p70S6k was elevated approximately .-fold in resting  -SG-/- EDL muscles incubated in normal oxygenated Ringer  solu- tion (Figure 3C; Normal). As in our previous studies, there was  - and .-fold increase of -ERK1 and -ERK2, respectively, in resting  -SG-/- EDL muscles (Figure 3A-; Normal). Because both of these pathways converge to phosphorylate S6RP, we compared the phosphorylation state of this protein in muscles from both genotypes. -SG-/- EDL muscles exhibited an -fold increase in -S6RP, which was consistent with the higher basal phosphorylation state of the upstream pathways (Figure 3D; Normal). Heightened mechanosensitive signaling could arise through increased flux of ions across the sarcolemma, particu- larly Ca2+ [17]. This could occur either through en- hanced activity of channels, such as the TRP family of cation channels (reviewed in [28,29]), or via membrane ruptures. To determine the calcium dependence of the ob- served differences in p70S6K and ERK1/ phosphorylation in  -SG-/- muscles, we incubated muscles in calcium-free Ringers solution, retaining the same ionic strength. Absence of extracellular Ca2+ did not alter the relative difference in -p70S6K between  -SG-/- and C57 muscles (Figure 3C). However, the increased -ERK1/ and -S6RP found in  -SG-/- muscles in normal Ringer  solu- tion was abrogated when there was no calcium in the bathing solution (Figure 3A,,). Thus, only p70S6K phosphorylation appeared to be calcium independent. Be- cause intracellular calcium stores can also alter the intra- cellular calcium concentration, particularly during muscle activation, tetracaine was used to inhibit sarcoplasmic reticulum release of Ca2+ through the ryanodine receptors. Verification of this inhibition was established in  separate experiment, through measuring tetanic force generation by EDL muscles before and after addition of tetracaine. After 15 min incubation with tetracaine, force production was virtually eliminated (force was 297 mN prior to addition of tetracaine, . mN after 15 min incubation with tetracaine and not detectable after 20 min incubation with tetracaine). Again, relative -p70S6K levels between the two muscle groups were not altered by tetracaine (Figure 3C). In contrast, blockade of SR Ca2+ release reduced -ERK1 levels in  -SG-/- muscles relative to C57 muscles, even though there was no alteration in -ERK2 Figure  p70S6K responds to stretch in C2C12 cells.

Phosphorylation of S6RP remained elevated in  -SG-/- muscles in the presence of tetracaine, but to  lesser extent than in normal Ringer  solution (Figure 3D). Taken together, both extracellular and intracellular cal- cium contribute to the heightened -ERK1 levels in  -SG-/- muscles, whereas the increase in basal -p70S6K in  -SG-/- muscles is not dependent on either extracellular or intracellular calcium. Differential p70S6K stretch response occurs in isolated C57 and  -SG-/- muscles Having established that -p70S6K changes at rest did not depend on calcium, we pursued the role of p70S6K in  -SG-dependent mechanotransduction in vivo. passive stretching protocol comprised of  15% strain, 20 times per min, for 30 min in high-glucose DMEM was sufficient to cause increased  -SG phosphorylation in the EDL, as is the case for eccentric contraction of the EDL (Figure 4A; [10]).

After 30 min of stretch, phosphoryl- ation of p70S6K at T389 and T421/S424 was increased to  similar degree in stretched C57 and  -SG-/- EDL mus- cles, compared to non-stretched controls. However, after 90 min of stretch, phosphorylation at T389 and T421/ S424 had decreased in stretched C57 muscles and was close to non-stretched levels. In contrast, phosphorylation at T389 was further increased, and T421/S424 phosphor- ylation remained elevated, in stretched  -SG-/- muscles, compared to non-stretched controls (Figure 4B-). For T389 phosphorylation after 90 min of stretch, genotype, stretch, and the interaction between them were all statisti- cally significant, by two-way ANOVA. T421/S424 showed  similar trend to T389; however, while the effect of stretch was statistically significant, the difference between genotypes was not. Thus, in contrast to primary cultures,  -SG-/- muscles exhibited heightened and prolonged activation of p70S6K in response to passive stretch, imply- ing that  -SG plays  role in p70S6K inactivation. Stretch response of p70S6K T389, but not S6RP, is rapamycin-sensitive in  -SG-/- muscles Because mTOR is  key mediator of p70S6K activation, we examined the effect of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin on stretch responses in isolated C57 and  -SG-/- muscles. EDL muscles were subjected to cyclic stretch for 90 min, as described above. Unlike in C2C12 cells and primary cultures, -Akt showed  trend to increase on stretching, which was statistically significant in  -SG-/- muscles. As anticipated, -Akt was unaffected by rapamycin (Figure 5A,). Rapamycin treatment completely blocked the increase in p70S6K T389 phosphorylation after passive stretch of C57 muscles, consistent with previous studies [36,37]. In  -SG-/- muscles, rapamycin abrogated most p70S6K T389 phosphorylation, but residual phosphorylation Figure  Elevated p70S6K in  -SG-/- muscles is independent of calcium.

Surprisingly, rapamycin blunted the p70S6K T421/S424 stretch response in C57 muscles, which is inconsistent with previous studies [36]. However, the T421/S424 response to stretch persisted in  -SG-/- muscles in the presence of rapamycin (Figure 5A,). S6RP phosphorylation increased in response to stretch in both C57 and  -SG-/- muscles. Interestingly, while rapamycin blocked stretch-induced phosphorylation of S6RP in C57 muscles, phosphorylation in response to stretch was preserved in  -SG-/- muscles (Figure 5A,). Taken together, these results suggest either that the level of active p70S6K remaining in  -SG-/- muscles is suffi- cient to phosphorylate S6RP regardless of rapamycin or that an alternate pathway bypasses p70S6K to phos- phorylate S6RP in muscles lacking  -SG. Discussion Skeletal muscle has  remarkable ability to adapt to changes in workload. Almost all muscle properties can be modulated, such as muscle fiber size, contractile properties and metabolism. Changes in patterns of gene expression as well as shifts in the balance between pro- tein synthesis and degradation are required to complete the adaptational response. Identification of major path- ways that directly regulate gene expression and protein synthesis/degradation demonstrate that multiple inputs (mechanical, chemical, and metabolic) can converge on final common pathways for muscle growth and adaptation (reviewed in [45]). However, sorting out the contribution of the wide variety of inputs on muscle adaptation has been more difficult. In our previous work, we used an eccentric contraction protocol to in- vestigate the dependence of ERK1/ mechano-sensing on phosphorylation of  -SG. However, this protocol alters multiple factors, including externally applied tension, internally generated tension and changes in extracellular and intracellular calcium fluxes, all of which potentially have effects on mechanosensitive signaling pathways. In the present study, we used  passive stretching protocol to isolate the effects of ex- ternally applied tension in the absence of active contrac- tion, in order to examine the downstream signaling in more detail. Passive stretching protocols can be performed in both cell cultures and whole muscle preparations, and the reductionist approach of utilizing cultures can eliminate some of the physiological complexities associated with intact or isolated muscles. As such, our initial experi- ments using C2C12 cells were key to identifying p70S6K as being activated in response to stretch, in contrast to the lack of response by ERK1/, Akt, or FAK. Primary myotubes generated from C57 or  -SG-/- mice had the Figure  Differential p70S6K stretch response in isolated C57 and  -SG-/- muscles.

Even though these experiments displayed trends towards differ- ential activation of p70S6K after stretch, the inherent variability of the preparation impaired identification of signaling patterns that were dependent upon either stretch or  -SG. Thus, we returned to isolated muscles from C57 and  -SG-/- mice to investigate  -SG-dependent mechano- transduction pathways. Using this model, we observed  modest increase of -p70S6K in  -SG-/- muscles at rest that was independent of intra- or extracellular calcium, and  prolonged activation of p70S6K following stretch. These results support  role for  -SG in particular, or the SG complex in general, in mechanical signal transduction, where the loss of this protein leads to an increase in activation, and deficit in deactivation, or  combination of both. Given the dependence of our findings on the experi- mental platform utilized, future directions will include verification of the results in an even more intact system, such as in situ muscle preparations or whole animals. An intriguing explanation for our in vivo results is that  -SG is required for dephosphorylation and deactivation of p70S6K. There is considerable evidence that p70S6K is directly dephosphorylated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), independently of mTOR [46-49]. The phosphat- ase PHLPP has also been shown to target p70S6K [50]. -SG may mediate the activation of these phosphatases in response to sustained mechanical stimulation. Alter- natively,  -SG may regulate pathways that deactivate p70S6K indirectly. For example, the phosphatase SHP- can cause mTOR-dependent dephosphorylation of p70S6K [51,52]. Further studies will be required to define the inacti- vation pathway disrupted by  -SG loss.

Further, as previously shown, passive stretch causes greater Ca2+ influx into myotubes lacking members of the SG complex [17], raising the possibility that the mechanical signal transduction pathways we eval- uated previously may be modulated not only by the SG complex, but also by additional channels in the sarco- lemma. To address this, we examined the contribution of calcium to the elevated p70S6K and ERK1/ activity found in  -SG-/- muscles. We found that the elevation of -ERK1/ in the absence of  -SG was dependent on both internal and external sources of calcium. In contrast, the difference in basal -p70S6K between C57 and  -SG-/- muscles was not calcium dependent. This suggests that while ERK1/ activation may lie downstream of the cal- cium misregulation that occurs in SG-deficient muscle, changes in p70S6K activation may be  more direct conse- quence of the absence of the SG complex. This is of great interest given that  -SG has been shown to be important for mechanotransduction, but the downstream signaling pathways are uncharacterized [10,11]. Furthermore, p70S6K has been implicated in mechanotransduction in skeletal muscle, but the upstream initiation signals are not known [36,53-55]. However, it should be noted that SG-deficient muscle undergoes substantial degeneration and subsequent regeneration, which may also explain the elevated basal p70S6K, which is transiently increased during regeneration [56]. Our study found that the pattern of differential p70S6K phosphorylation in response to stretch in  -SG-/- muscles was similar both for phosphorylation of T389, which cor- relates with kinase activity, and for T421/S424, two of the four phosphorylation sites in the autoinhibitory domain. Phosphorylation of T389 is mTOR-dependent, while phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain is carried out by proline-directed kinases. Furthermore, it is thought that phosphorylation of the autoinhibitory domain is ne- cessary for phosphorylation of T389 [37]. The correlation between phosphorylation of T421/S424 and T389 in our isolated muscle model therefore suggests that phosphoryl- ation of the autoinhibitory domain was the rate-limiting step for p70S6K activation, an intriguing prospect given that the autoinhibitory domain may be targeted by ERK1/  [57]. Therefore,  future hypothesis to test is that differ- ential p70S6K activation is  downstream consequence of differential ERK1/ activation in  -SG-/- muscle. This would implicate Ca2+ as an indirect modulator of p70S6K activity, since the increase in -ERK1/ in  -SG-/- muscle is dependent upon heightened Ca2+ flux. It is worth noting that recent work by others has shown that stretch- induced activation of mTOR and p70S6K at T389 is inde- pendent of ERK1/ [54], which can regulate mTOR via tuberous sclerosis proteins  and  and Raptor [58-60]. However, this pathway is separate from the putative direct phosphorylation of the p70S6K T421/S424 autoinhibitory domain sites by ERK1/. Our experiments with rapamycin showed that, for both C57 and  -SG-/- muscles, phosphorylation of p70S6K at T389 is mTOR-dependent, consistent with previous stud- ies [36,37]. The T421/S424 autoinhibitory domain sites were phosphorylated in response to stretch in both C57 and  -SG-/- muscles, which was different to our initial experiment in stretched isolated muscles, where the C57 response had diminished by 90 min of stretching. How- ever, in the presence of rapamycin, this response was not present. This is surprising given that the T421/S424 sites are not thought to be targeted by mTOR. Previous studies have shown these sites to be rapamycin-insensitive [36], but recent evidence suggests  modest mTOR de- pendence [61]. In  -SG-/- muscles, rapamycin had no ef- fect on T421/S424 phosphorylation. Further experiments are needed to fully understand the role of mTOR on phos- phorylation of the p70S6K autoinhibitory domain in C57 and  -SG-/- skeletal muscle. Interestingly, the stretch- induced phosphorylation of S6RP was rapamycin sensitive in C57 muscles, but not in  -SG-/- muscles. This suggests that an alternative pathway can bring about S6RP phos- phorylation in  -SG-/- muscles when p70S6K is not acti- vated. One possibility is that S6RP is phosphorylated by p90 ribosomal S6 kinase, which is activated by ERK; this is consistent with the increase in basal ERK1/ in  -SG-/- muscles, and the over-response of ERK2 on mechanical stimulation by eccentric contraction [10]. We did not observe  strong Akt response to passive stretch, or any difference between C57 and  SG-/-, im- plying that mTOR and/or p70S6K were being activated through Akt-independent pathways. This is consistent with previous studies showing that Akt does not respond to mechanical stimulation in skeletal muscle, and that p70S6K phosphorylation in response to stretch is inde- pendent of PI3K [62]. We also did not see increased phosphorylation of FAK in response to passive stretch in C2C12 cells or primary myotubes. Although integrins can participate in mechanotransduction, it appears that our cyclic passive stretch protocols did not cause integrin activation. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the details of crosstalk between SG-dependent and integrin-dependent signaling pathways, as well as the role of calcium in these signaling cascades. Based on our findings, we position  SG as  mechano- sensor, schematized in Figure , that is important for tran- sient ERK1/ activation during active contractions, as well as modulation of p70S6K activation during passive stretch. Because passive stretch does not appear to in- crease -FAK or -Akt,  SG is likely to regulate p70S6K through other pathways. These may include regulation of ERK1/, which can promote p70S6K activation indir- ectly via mTOR or directly by phosphorylation of the Moorwood et al. Skeletal Muscle 2014, :13 Page 10 of 13\n\nautoinhibitory domain, and/or phosphatases such as PP2A that dephosphorylate p70S6K. Loss of  SG un- couples the response to stretch, which may contribute to muscle pathology. The stability of the SG complex is directly affected in several LGMDs and in DMD, and  significant part of the pathology in these diseases appears to be inappropriate load sensing. The first step in therapeutic development is identifying and understanding the target, but little is cur- rently known about the role of the SG complex in load sensing. Therefore, understanding the functions that are disrupted and the pathways that are involved in mechano- transduction involving the SG complex will help in the de- sign of therapies for LGMDs and DMD. While restoration of  completely normal SG complex either through gene correction or protein replacement would also normalize mechanical signal transduction, this may not be possible for all mutations responsible for DMD and LGMD. It is known that localization of the SG complex is not the sole criterion for appropriate signaling [11]. Hence, other proteins may be necessary to correct signaling even when the complex is restored, and downstream pathways may emerge as more feasible therapeutic targets. We do not know whether the enhanced basal and stretch-responsive activation of p70S6K in  -SG-/- muscle contributes to pathology or compensates for it. Likewise, it is not clear whether inhibition of p70S6K would have  beneficial or  detrimental effect in dystrophic muscle. Muscle specific gene targeting of mTORC1 components induces myopathy [63,64] and overexpression of integrin   can improve the dystrophic phenotype through increased survival signaling via p70S6K [65], suggesting that p70S6K inhibition would not be advantageous. However, treatment of mdx mice with the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin improves the dys- trophic phenotype [66]. It is also interesting to note that p70S6K is inhibited by glucocorticoids, which are used in the treatment of DMD and LGMD [67]. Our results begin to provide mechanistic insight into how mechanical signaling is disrupted and altered in the absence of  -SG. In addition to increasing our under- standing of the normal function of the SG complex, there is potential to provide more refined targets that could be beneficial to patients either in isolation or in combination with other therapeutic approaches. Conclusions We have identified p70S6K as part of  novel SG- dependent mechanosensitive signaling pathway in skeletal muscle. Our results suggest that  -SG is required for the inactivation of p70S6K following its activation in response to mechanical stimulation. These studies provide new insights into the normal function of the SG complex, and the mechanisms by which its deficiency in some forms of muscular dystrophy may contribute to pathology.

Remarkably, these changes bear similarities to those observed during the aging process on Earth. However, our understanding of the connection between these molecular shifts and disease development in space remains limited. Frailty syndrome,  clinical syndrome associated with biological aging, has not been comprehensively investigated during spaceflight. To bridge this knowledge gap, we leveraged murine data obtained from NASA  GeneLab, along with astronaut data gathered from the JAXA and Inspiration4 missions. Our objective was to assess the presence of biological markers and pathways related to frailty, aging, and sarcopenia within the spaceflight context. Through our analysis, we identified notable changes in gene expression patterns that may be indicative of the development of  frailty-like condition during space missions. These findings suggest that the parallels between spaceflight and the aging process may extend to encompass frailty as well. Consequently, further investigations exploring the utility of  frailty index in monitoring astronaut health appear to be warranted.

Future missions to Mars as well as long-duration missions to the Moon will be significantly more sustained than any previous deep space mission. During transit, the space environment presents key challenges for astronauts   safety1. Previous literature describes microgravity, radiation exposure, isolation and confinement as major stressors that are able to induce pathophysiological changes in the heart, skeletal muscle, and immune system, as well as bone loss, central nervous system alterations, and increased cancer  risk2 . Thus, there is increasing interest to identify the molecular mecha- nisms driving those health risks, including changes in mitochondrial function, genetic and epigenetic regulation, telomere-length dynamics, DNA damage, and oxidative  stress3, (Fig. ). Interestingly, the molecular mechanisms of spaceflight-related stressors share similarities with the hallmarks of aging: mitochondrial dysfunction, genomic\n\nVol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:13098 |  www.nature.com/scientificreports/ instability, epigenetic alterations, and telomere length changes (including brief elongation in flight and increased shorter telomeres post-flight), cellular senescence, and dysbiosis, among  others6. As  defined set of aging-related Figure . Effects of spaceflight and  model of aging. Human spaceflight presents five major challenges: space radiation, altered gravity, isolation and confinement, distance from Earth, and hostile/closed environments are hazards for crewed spaceflight. These stressors support pathophysiological alterations and cellular and molecular changes which could be involved in the development of biological aging and frailty in astronauts. Muscle loss in astronauts has  similar pathophysiology as sarcopenia in the elderly. Created using BioRender. Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:13098 |  www.nature.com/scientificreports/ molecular changes, the hallmarks of aging may be specifically studied to assess spaceflight impact on human physiology, which could induce  condition similar to premature or pathological  aging3. Aging is  state of depleted biological resilience resulting in an increased vulnerability to stressors. It leads to  systemic loss of the body  capacity to maintain homeostasis and  health3. The aging phenotype manifests in metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, neurological deterioration, and  cancer7. Old age is also marked by immune dysregulation, which can result in  chronic low-grade inflammation state called inflammag- ing,  status associated with increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers in blood and  tissues8. The deteriora- tion in muscle quality and quantity is another feature of aging, characterized by altered myofiber metabolism and impaired satellite cell  activity9. Loss of muscle mass increases the risk of developing other comorbidities, in  vicious cycle that leads to unhealthy aging. These traits are often associated with  multifactorial geriatric syndrome known as  frailty 10. Frailty,  recent concept in aging science, can be defined as  syndrome caused by the combined effect of numerous age-related alterations. These alterations lead to  depletion of physiological reserve and/or deterio- ration of cognitive functions, resulting in an increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Frailty can be clinically diagnosed by the presence of three or more of the following components: unintentional weight loss over the last year, weakness, exhaustion, slow gait, and low physical activity  level11. Other criteria for diagnosing and assess- ing frailty are functional factors such as grip strength and gait  speed12,13. More holistic definitions of frailty also consider the presence of comorbidities, cognitive impairment, psychosocial risk factors and other common geriatric  syndromes14. The use of clinical scores to quantify frailty has been attempted, but it is undermined by encountered limitations in terms of ethnicity, risk prediction, diagnosis, and prognosis. However, advancements in the understanding of the biological processes related to frailty and aging, along with the development of high- throughput techniques, allowed the development of novel assessment models based on  omics   biomarkers15. Part of the deconditioning of human physiology caused by spaceflight resembles the features of frail patients, for instance the physical component related to muscle loss. Sarcopenia is generally defined as  progressive age-related condition characterized by the loss of skeletal muscle quality, performance, strength, and  mass16. When this condition is driven by aging, it is defined as primary  sarcopenia9. Interestingly, muscle loss in astronauts shares similarities with sarcopenia in the elderly, especially during long duration spaceflight, and could be interpreted as  sarcopenia-like  syndrome17,18. The study of frailty traits in astronauts involves the investigation of aging  biological pathways, which could be elicited by the space environment. Yet, despite the reported similarities between the features of frailty and consequence of spaceflight, it remains unclear whether the space environment can influence the onset of age- related dysfunctions in astronauts. Getting insights about the signatures of frailty and sarcopenia in spaceflight data is  key step towards the development of countermeasures to achieve safer crewed space missions and translate therapy to patients on Earth. Here, we hypothesize the emergence of aging, frailty and sarcopenia related transcriptomic signatures during and after spaceflight in astronauts, murine and cellular models. We investigate this occurrence using multi-omics and systems-informatic approaches. We analyzed transcriptomic data from rodent research missions flown to the International Space Station (ISS) (available from NASA  Open Science Data Repository (OSDR), previously known as  GeneLab18), astronaut data from  recent JAXA study, and data from the first civilian commercial spaceflight mission, Inspiration4 (i4). We identified altered expres- sion in genes related to frailty and muscle loss, that may lead to an early frailty phenotype. Our results raise the possibility that exposure to the space environment leads to changes consistent with frailty, including inflamma- tion, muscle wasting and other age-related features. Our findings propose  method to study the development of frailty-related health risks, which astronauts may develop during spaceflight, in the perspective of achieving adequate preventative measures. Results Multiple frailty related biomarkers are differentially expressed in rodent muscles during spaceflight To determine the impact of frailty during spaceflight, we constructed, based on previous  literature19 22,  list of putative frailty biomarker genes for humans and mice (Supplementary Data ). Mouse (OSD-21, 99, 101, 103, 104, 105) datasets from OSDR were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in flight versus control condition with  statistical cut-off of adjusted -value < .. In mice, altered expression of frailty-related genes in the following tissues were identified: gastrocnemius (34 genes in OSD-21 and  genes in OSD-101); extensor digitorum longus (EDL) (45 genes in OSD-99); quadriceps (26 genes in OSD-101); soleus (36 genes in OSD-104); tibialis anterior (32 genes in OSD-105) (Fig. 2A). maximum number of four frailty-related genes was also found to be unique to each tissue type and  maximum number of  was common between the differ- ent datasets (Supplementary Data ).",

Summary themes of each functional cluster are displayed by the external color panel at the right side of sub-figure  and . Despite  mixed direction of regulation,  clear enrichment of these pathways in the spaceflight group when compared to the control was evident across the datasets. The soleus muscle revealed an increase in the innate immune response inflammatory signature and concomitant downregulation of the IGF- pathway (Fig. 3B). Previous literature showed that the soleus muscle is the first to be impacted by spaceflight and also known to experience  significant dysregulation of mitochondrial and immune functions in  space24. Immune response can downregulate IGF- anabolic activity, promoting muscle  wasting16. Of note, this muscle shows the largest decline in mass in the RR1 mission and IGF- pathway might be  involved25. Several putative aging-related pathways were enriched in human datasets (Fig. 3C), showing up-regulation in the majority of cases. Of note, interferon alpha and gamma response pathways are upregulated in all the datasets investigated. The increase in immune and inflammatory signatures we identified is consistent with various reports that asso- ciate chronic inflammation with frailty, although causality has yet to be  established8,26. Nonetheless, our results Figure . Evidence of shared catabolic pathways between sarcopenia and frailty markers and their differential expression in space-flown mice.

Novel sarcopenia related genes are differentially expressed during spaceflight Sarcopenia is  condition associated with frailty. In our analysis, the best predictors of sarcopenia were genes that are part of autophagic and protein degradation processes. After studying databases from 118 people with and without sarcopenia (GSE111006, GSE111010, and GSE111016)27, ,892 DEGs were identified by performing Mann Whitney   tests28 on gene expression data for every single gene (.., 65,217 genes) in  pair-wise manner across samples from both sets of patients (Supplementary Data ). simple classifier (.., -nearest neighbors) was then used to estimate individual predictive power for that  condition29. Next, via co-expression network analysis upon these DEGs, the most highly correlated module (.., BROWN = .93) to sarcopenia was found. We used  pathway and gene ontology analysis upon BROWN to curate  list of 21 genes that were significantly enriched in biological processes related to  sarcopenia30. Here, we found that the frailty biomarkers list was enriched in Biological Processes Gene Ontology (BP GO) terms in  very similar manner to those found with sarcopenic biomarkers alone (Fig. 4A)29. In addition to BP GO, the same was true for molecular functions (MF) GO term enrichment (Fig. 4C). Interestingly, we found that eight of the biomarkers identified for frailty had the ability to predict sarcopenia in GSE111006, GSE111010, and GSE111016 with  Mean Accuracy Score (MAS) of > .65 (RP1L1, SH3GL3, HIF1A, FGF23, FASLG, MAS1, PAX5, and REV1) (Fig. 4B,). Using the sarcopenia gene expression classifier we had established above, we re-examined the existing datasets for alterations in the 21 genes. To do so, we took the expression data from the murine datasets (EDL (ODS-99), left gastrocnemius (ODS-101), quadriceps (ODS-103), soleus (ODS-104), and tibialis anterior (ODS-105)) and evaluated the expression of our sarcopenia classifier (Fig. 4E). We found that only GJB4, HNRNPCL1, GOLGA2 Figure . Frailty-related biomarkers are differentially expressed in humans during spaceflight and ground- based spaceflight simulated conditions.

GJB4 is  connexin (Cx) gene encoding the gap junction protein CX30.331. HNRNPCL1 plays  role in consolidating the nucleosome and neutralizing core hnRNPs  proteins32.

Of note, the dataset from the soleus muscle in mice (OSD-104), demonstrated to have  significant overexpression of GJB4, POMC and significant downregulation of HNRNPC ( < .05). Multiple frailty related biomarkers are differentially expressed in human muscles during spaceflight We applied the same list of putative frailty biomarker genes (Supplementary Data ) to investigate differentially expressed genes in Open Science Dataset  human samples as in Fig. . OSD-52 and 195 were analyzed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in flight, on random positioning machine or in bed rest versus control condition with  statistical cut-off of adjusted -value < .. Vastus lateralis muscle (OSD-52), cardiac progeni- tors (OSD-127) and endothelial cells (OSD-195) showed 22,  and  frailty-related genes, respectively (Fig. 5A). We compared the differential expression profiles between mice and human dataset. Approximately  third of the frailty genes were conserved between humans and mice, which suggests that the murine models can provide good translation to human biology (Fig. 5B). Out of 73 differentially expressed frailty-related genes, 22 (32%) were common in humans and mice (Fig. 5B). Forty-three (62%) were unique to mice and  (%) were unique to only humans. In humans,  frailty genes were upregulated and 13 were downregulated in the vastus lateralis muscle (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Data ). Several downregulated genes were associated with immunity-related pathways, while most upregulated genes were associated with metabolism and Vitamin  or  pathways. In endothelial cells, two genes were downregu- lated, and two were upregulated. The downregulated genes, TMEM245 and PPARGC1A, are associated with the cell-membrane and gluconeogenesis, while the upregulated genes, MSTN and PTGS2, are associated with regulation of skeletal muscle growth and prostaglandin biosynthesis (Supplementary Data )35. While there is no direct link between gluconeogenesis and frailty, both are related to the body  response to stress and main- taining homeostasis. Diabetes,  condition that affects glucose metabolism, has been linked to  frailty36,37. In diabetes, the body  ability to regulate blood glucose levels is impaired, potentially impacting gluconeogenesis. Frail individuals, who have  diminished ability to resist stressors, may be more susceptible to the effects of these metabolic  imbalances38. Multiple frailty related biomarkers are differentially expressed in astronauts Having confirmed altered aging and frailty signatures in largely rodent transcriptomic data, we wanted to test if frailty biomarkers were also altered in astronauts. To enable this analysis, we used two recent  studies39. First, using astronaut data from JAXA plasma cell-free RNA profiling study, we examined the changes occurring in RNAs from the frailty biomarker genes between pre-flight, in-flight, and post-flight (.., after return to Earth) (Fig. ). Our RNA analysis reveals  global response of frailty-related gene expression to the space environment, which is characterized by in-flight and post-flight expression changes. Most of the genes investigated were subject to changes when compared to pre-flight conditions, either during spaceflight or later after return to Earth. large number of genes that were reduced during spaceflight showed an increase after re-entry (.., AKT1, NOS2, FGF23, and HIF3A). Conversely, several genes show an opposite behavior and tended to be reduced during spaceflight, and underwent reduction after re-entry (.., TGFB1, B2M, NOS1, AOC1, SOD2, SOD3, and OAZ1). Interestingly, cell-free RNAs from several genes (.,. FGF23, KRT18, AKT1, B2M, NOS1, AOC1, SOD2 and SOD3) did not return to the pre-flight baseline levels, even after 120 days.

An interesting observation emerging from the data is the increased cell-free RNA signature of HIF1A and HIF3A post-flight. Hypoxia Inducible Factor (HIF) is  key regulator of immune cell  function42, and its dysregulation could alter immune response. We also observe an increase of RNAs derived from several nitric oxide (NO) related genes, which are biologic mediators in multiple Figure .

It is understood that nitric oxide (NO) is  key vasodilator in the cardiovascular system and its synthesis is catalyzed by the enzyme family nitric oxide synthases (NOS), neuronal (NOS1), inducible (NOS2) and endothelial synthases (NOS3)43. NOS1 and NOS2 are constitutively expressed by tubules of the human kidney, while NOS3 is expressed by endothelial cells and is implicated with the formation and maintenance of vascularized tissues. Furthermore, AKT1 plays  role in the signal transduction of growth factors, as well as in cell survival, cellular senescence, and aging. There is evidence that AKT signaling is associated with an imbalance of phosphatidylinositide -kinases that is altering the aged  brain44. Chronic AKT activation intensified aging-induced cardiac hypertrophy in murine heart  tissues45. In connection to phosphate intake, FGF23 is known to be secreted from the skeletal system and influence the kidneys through the klotho gene receptor36. The upregulation of HIF-related genes could be interpreted through findings from earlier studies which have implicated the HIF pathway with the impairment of energy-dependent cellular processes, and mutations in mitochondrial DNA which accelerate aging  processes41,46. Next, we used data from the first civilian commercial -day space mission (referred to as Inspiration4 (I4), to examine the impact of short-duration spaceflight on putative frailty biomarker transcriptomic  signature47. From the I4 mission, single-cell gene expression data from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were generated and compared across multiple timepoints (Fig. 7A). Frailty genes were increased in PBMCs and subpopulations post-flight compared to pre-flight timepoints, and the percentage of the increased genes were higher than the percentage of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (Fig. 7B). The percentage of increased frailty genes was the highest in PBMCs, lowest in dendritic cells (DCs), and similar in the remaining subpopulations (Fig. 7B). Generally, the average expression and percentage of expression of the increased genes were increased at  +  compared to pre-flights (-92, -44, -) and returned to baseline over time (Fig. 7C). For example, several genes were upregulated in various pathways at  +  compared to pre-flight and reverted to baseline over time. Implicated pathways include: immunity (ARG2, PPARD), EGFR trafficking (ATXN2), regulators of apoptosis (BCL2L1, FAS), survival factor for neuronal cell types (CNTF), cell cell signaling (JAG1), metabolism (PPARD), DNA repair (REV1), neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission (SNX14), structural component of sarcomeric -line (TMEM245) and cell cycle regulation (TP53) (Fig. 7C). Metabolic flux simulations of gene expression changes reveal dysregulation of metabolic functions related to frailty Having found alterations in gene expression associated with aging and frailty and knowing that biologic systems are dynamic, we used  subset of the gene expression to examine dynamic changes in metabolism. We applied our updated, context-specific, metabolic models that performed custom-made flux balance analysis (FBA) simu- lations. Here, we used two different transcriptional changes (RNA-seq) between flight and ground (OSD-91 (GSE65943) for cultured human TK6 lymphoblastoid cells; and OSD-127 (-GEOD-84582) for cardiomyocytes from human pluripotent stem cells) (Fig. ). In TK6 lymphoblastoid cells, microgravity led to transcriptional changes through altered methylation pat- terns. These transcriptional changes, in turn, altered the oxidative stress and carbohydrate metabolism  pathways48. However, the flux simulation analysis showed that other pathways associated with lipid metabolism, fatty acid oxidation, fatty acid synthesis, and bile acid synthesis, are downregulated during flight. While chondroitin sulfate degradation, nucleotide interconversion, and peroxisomal transport are upregulated. Considering the carbohy- drate metabolism aspect of the flux simulation analysis, only pyruvate metabolism (end product of glycolysis) showed significantly altered expression in microgravity (Figs. 8A,). By contrast, the other metabolic flux simulation displayed marked up-regulation during flight in lipid metabolism associated pathways: fatty acid oxidation, fatty acid synthesis, and glycerophospholipid metabolism (Figs. 8B,). The cells also exhibited increased galactose metabolism, nucleotide interconversion, Coenzyme  (CoA) synthesis, glutathione metabolism, as well as pentose phosphate pathway in carbohydrate metabolism. The only significant downregulation in microgravity was detected in folate metabolism. This cardiomyocyte study (using 3D tissue engineering of cardiac progenitors from human pluripotent stem cells) found increased gene expression levels associated with growth, development, and survival for cardiac progenitors in  microgravity49. Discussion To our knowledge, no prior links to frailty-like signatures have been observed in the context of spaceflight, and these markers represent an important direction for future research, especially as mission durations increase to years. In recent years, human space research has benefitted from collecting and integrating diverse types of biological data, such as genomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, and storing them in biobanks for future  analysis19,50. These multi-omics data and biobanks continue to provide valuable insights into the aging-like pro- cesses in astronauts during long-term space missions and help identify potential biomarkers and interventions to counteract  them25,51 53. In our manuscript, we include data from NASA  OSDR, the SpaceX Inspiration4 and the JAXA astronaut study. These initiatives are hallmarks in the development of data banking strategies such as the Space Omics and Medical Atlas (SOMA)54. The NASA Twins study along with the JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome and Inspiration4 data reported here and elsewhere (Figs. and ) highlight the emerging ability to conduct omic analyses on astronaut samples 27,39,55. We propose the use of omics data to investigate the develop- ment of aging-like phenomena in spaceflight, which can also help improve our understanding of aging metrics like clonal  hematopoiesis56, and also link to  wide array of new data from the SOMA package of data and papers 48,53,55,55,57 65. Space medicine research has been mostly focused on the acute and medium-term effects of spaceflight on human physiology. However, some attributes related to the exposure to the space environment resemble aging-like pathophysiology: DNA damage, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial  dysfunction3. Because of these\n\n11 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:13098 |  www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Figure . Metabolic flux simulation analysis on OSD-91 and OSD-127.

In contrast with aging on Earth, it is unclear whether those molecular modifications last after reen- try, and for this reason we refer to them as aging-like phenomena. Nevertheless, despite acute events such as space motion sickness and autonomic imbalance resolving after astronaut  return to ground, the effects of these aging-like alterations might be clinically manifest in  chronic exposure scenario, like  long-duration mission to Mars, and could potentially trigger chronic disease development. Studies in genetic/genomic aging models such as . elegans and clinical evidence have demonstrated that the control of lifespan and health span are not  identical49,53; therefore, there is an increasing need to identify mark- ers able to determine the biological age of an individual. One proposed marker is the frailty index, which can serve as  better health indicator than chronological age, translating what is suggested by previous biological and clinical  literature7. Here, we examined if aging and putative frailty biomarkers change during spaceflight. Our results from both rodent and human samples suggest that alterations indeed occurred in aging-related pathways to  different extent depending on the tissue. Importantly, we also found changes in expression of putative frailty genes, raising the possibility that these could be used as indicators of physiological changes during spaceflight much as they are being examined for utility in clinical assessment of physiological changes with age on Earth. Beyond health assessment, the ability to conduct -omic studies on astronauts allows for combining astronaut and model organism datasets in order to conduct truly translational research in space. Such studies would expand our understanding of molecular control of (patho)physiological changes in response to spaceflight. The expression of putative frailty related biomarkers in JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome samples is altered during spaceflight, compared to ground control, as shown in Fig.",

Such studies would expand our understanding of molecular control of (patho)physiological changes in response to spaceflight. The expression of putative frailty related biomarkers in JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome samples is altered during spaceflight, compared to ground control, as shown in Fig. ; interestingly, several gene expression levels do not return to baseline after reentry. Although their expression could revert to normal after  longer period, this altered expression could hint to the presence of spaceflight-induced modifications that persist for longer than expected. For example, AKT1 is upregulated at all timepoints after reentry. persisted upregulation of the gene is linked to age related cardiac disease and dementia in animal  models45,46. The presence of biomarker gene expression that does not revert to normal challenges the concept that every physiological change induced by spaceflight is reverted after astronauts  return to Earth. This notion is not novel, for example,  recent report showed the development of distinct mutational profiles in  astronauts66; on these bases, it would be worth monitoring these biomarkers for longer timepoints after reentry, and to exclude the possibility that they underlie any sub-clinical disease development. Permanent modifications after exposure to important stressors happen in patients as well. For instance, admission to Intensive Care Unit and severe COVID-19 have been associated with epigenetic changes that might alter aging-related gene  expression45,46. In addition to long-term spaceflight exposure, short-duration spaceflight data such as those provided by the i4 mission are also relevant to detect early signs of frailty development. In fact, frailty is not only associated to long term chronic disease pathways: clinical research hints that short term exposure to stressors such as COVID-19 hyperinflammatory response are capable of developing frailty-associated  traits56. Regardless, longer spaceflight duration might be required to detect wider alterations in putative frailty biomarkers and clinically manifested phenotypes in astronauts; this highlights the need for further studies and validation. Differential expression of frailty genes in astronauts  cell-free DNA and PBMCs (Figs. and ) is not inher- ently the same as what is observed in the Open Science Dataset  (OSDs) human samples (Fig. ). Despite frailty signals potentially being detected in astronaut  blood, it is not feasible to directly pair this result with the dif- ferential expression of frailty-related genes in muscle biopsies, due to the absence of matched data. As previously suggested, this represents an opportunity to apply cutting-edge clinical research tools for moni- toring and researching astronaut health. Indeed, genome sequencing onboard the ISS is currently used in the microbiological monitoring  program67, paving the way for use in astronaut studies on the ISS. Previous studies of astronaut health have largely been conducted using standard clinical markers such as blood panels. While there is an emerging blood panel for assessment of  frailty68, these would need to be processed on Earth. By contrast, the assessment of  future clinically validated transcriptomic panel for frailty could be conducted on ISS or other spacecrafts. Regardless of which panel or where such  panel is assessed, our findings suggest that future studies aimed at establishing such  validated model for astronauts could be fruitful areas of investigation for monitoring and improving astronaut health in- and post-flight. The establishment and validation of such  panel could either be done by correlating with physiological measures already captured by NASA  standard measures program or correlating with physiological measures adapted from the emerging frailty indexes. One of the most pronounced findings in both rodent and human datasets is the induction of interferon alpha and gamma responsive pathways. Interferons are cytokines associated with modulation of the immune response which is  known consequence of  spaceflight69. Our observation of the activation of interferon pathways (Fig. ) suggests that the activation of the innate immune system is  conserved mammalian response to spaceflight and aging. In the aging field, the concept of inflammaging suggests that the chronic low-grade dysregulation of the immune system that happens with aging underpins the development of diseases such as atherosclerosis, type II diabetes, and  sarcopenia7. Indeed, at least ten clinical biomarkers of inflammation correlate well with the frailty  index70. Making the inflammaging parallel to spaceflight, it could be that an increased low-grade inflammatory response during spaceflight drives and/or worsens frailty and/or related processes (for example muscle wast- ing)67,71. Low grade inflammation contributes to the development of endothelial dysfunction and atherosclerosis on  Earth7,72. In addition, radiation exposure can also lead to the development of cardiovascular disease in case of occupational exposure, as well as in cancer patients undergoing radiation  therapy69,71,73. In astronauts, ath- erosclerosis could be promoted by an increased inflammatory status promoted by different stressors of the space environment (Fig. ), and radiation exposure would play  primary role for it. Moon and Mars missions have  different radiation environment compared with the ISS, as astronauts traveling beyond Low Earth Orbit are potentially exposed to higher doses of galactic cosmic rays and solar particle event  radiation69. Elevated radiation\n\n13 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:13098 |  www.nature.com/scientificreports/ exposure promotes multiple dysregulations, causing cellular senescence in the endothelium, mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation, driving endothelial  dysfunction71. Exposure to higher doses of space radiation beyond low Earth orbit could also have  different, and perhaps increased, impact on frailty-related hallmarks and genes. Concerning endothelial dysfunction, an interplay between nitric oxide metabolism, production of reactive oxygen species and radiation exposure could play  role in the development of radiation-induced car- diovascular disease, as well as other disease pathways, in  space74,75. Moreover,  pro-inflammatory and oxidative environment might facilitate the development of the spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome (SANS)76; this condition would also increase the disability status of the crew. Across species, altered metabolism is one of the most consistently reported responses to spaceflight. Unsur- prisingly, these changes vary from organism to organism among microbes and tissue to tissue in animals (Fig. ). recent rodent transcriptomic study confirmed that the typical mammalian coordination of metabolism between the liver and muscles on Earth continues to function similarly in  flight77. This metabolic axis is  key determinator of health with age, whose disruption is associated with obesity, diabetes, and frailty. Emerging techniques such as metabolomics are beginning to address the role and mechanisms of metabolic alteration in human muscle with  age73. Here we have employed another emerging analytical approach, metabolic flux modeling from tran- scriptomic data (Fig. ). Our results confirm that metabolic flux analysis successfully demonstrated metabolic alterations as expected, dependent on tissue type. Importantly, while our results confirm past observations that mitochondrial and metabolic changes are conserved features of space flown tissues and  organisms3, they also demonstrate that the functional changes via metabolic flux are more important than the simple global up versus down changes often employed with reductionist approaches. The effect of microgravity exposure may cause specific mitochondrial protein adaptations that affect skeletal muscle tissue, namely -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity, palmitate oxidation and cytochrome  oxidase enzymatic  activity75,78,79. It is noteworthy that tissues might respond differently to microgravity and the mitochondrial bioenergetics adaptations seen in skeletal muscle may be different from the ones seen in cardiac muscle; however new sequencing data may provide an insight into these  differences18,75. Thus, using data from multiple tissues and time points begins to provide  more comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the development of frailty in response to spaceflight. Importantly, our results demonstrate that these approaches can be employed directly in astronauts and/or in combination with model systems. Muscle decline is another conserved feature between spaceflight and aging. It is also thought to contribute to frailty. Recently, functional measures of muscle decline with age have been well correlated with evolutionarily conserved gene expression changes with  age27,74. In humans, changes in metabolic gene expression appear to occur prior to changes in inflammatory gene expression, suggesting that aging human muscle undergoes meta- bolic remodeling prior to becoming inflamed and sarcopenic also highlighting the importance of temporal/ dynamic  data71. Similarly, in humans subjected to bedrest, an analogue for spaceflight, changes in metabolic gene expression and metabolic activity are an early event tied to altered intramuscular calcium  levels80. The recent study of muscle-liver metabolic cross talk in mice used the same mouse muscle datasets we used for this manu- script (Fig. ) and found altered glucose and lipid metabolism in response to spaceflight, consistent with past literature on space flown mammalian  muscle77. Combining this past analysis with our new analysis of sarcopenic gene expression changes, it is noteworthy that few sarcopenic gene expression changes are noted in the space flown muscles with more observed changes in the soleus, which was the muscle displaying the largest decline in  mass25. Together, these results raise the possibility that metabolic changes may indeed precede the loss of muscle mass in spaceflight, as observed with age and bedrest on Earth. It remains an open question if, like sarcopenia, metabolic alterations occur earlier than the inflammatory alterations in flight and whether inflammation or an altered metabolism is the key driver for  frailty-like phenotype in space. Lastly, given the similarities between transcriptomic changes with age and spaceflight, the facts that estrogen receptor has recently been proposed to be  key regulator of muscle gene expression changes with age and that estrogen receptor pathways have recently been shown to display differences in flight, raise the possibility that estrogen receptor pathways are key modula- tors of muscle health in  space27,77,81. The restriction of available sources poses  frequent challenge in the field of space medical and biological research. In order to adequately tackle our research inquiry with comprehensive information, we adopted  diverse range of data from various public sources. It is essential to note that each individual experimental model incorporated does not entirely encapsulate the complete biology of astronauts exposed to space conditions. Therefore, caution is advised when extending conclusions from one model system to another or from cellular and tissue-level observations to the overall phenotypes of organisms. Nonetheless,  noteworthy aspect of our findings is the utilization of  weight-of-evidence approach, wherein data across multiple models are analyzed. This method reveals conserved pathways that consistently emerge in independent datasets, likely indicating fundamental biological responses akin to frailty in the context of spaceflight. Pursuing the development of biobanks for multi-omics data will deeply benefit space medicine and biology research. Yet, concurrently, bridging the gap between molecular changes, pathophysiological processes and phenotype devel- opment requires multi-omics biological data to be associated with individual physical metrics. This is crucial to investigate complex syndromes such as frailty. Future studies will be conducted to observe global and systemic impact on how the frailty index will change during spaceflight.

Analyses of NASA open science data repository datasets: differential gene expression and GSEA pathway analysis All murine data were obtained from NASA Open Science Data Repository (former GeneLab), where they were previously collected and shared by other investigators. No live animals were used in this investigation. The Open Science Data (OSD) we analyzed are: OSD-21, OSD-52, OSD-99, OSD-101, OSD-103, OSD-104, OSD-105 and OSD-195. Information regarding the chosen datasets is provided in Table . The Genelab datasets are re-analyzed to produce the -score. The Differential Expression (DE) analysis of RNA-Seq datasets (OSD-99, OSD-101, OSD-103, OSD-104, OSD-105) is performed using DESeq2 version .26.082, in  software version ... Expected counts from the RSEM step were extracted and rounded up to the next integer and used as input for DE analysis. The Differential Expression (DE) analysis of microarray datasets (OSD-21, OSD-52, OSD-195) is performed using the package limma, in  version ..274. The Ensembl IDs of the genes in the DE datasets were annotated to their corresponding gene symbols using the  package  biomaRt83,84. We performed gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) on the differentially expressed datasets using fGSEA package to determine to what extent aging and putative frailty pathways were impacted in  spaceflight85. Tentative aging and frailty gene pathways were downloaded from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)  joint project of UC San Diego and Broad  Institute23,86. MSigDB is  multicollection of databases among which are databases of curated gene sets, and databases of ontology gene sets that are used in pathway analysis. The latest version MSigDB v2022. was used in the pathway search. In search of pathways that are potentially related to frailty, in MSigDB, we entered keywords of processes that are common denominators to aging in different  organisms66. The processes of interest are: changes in genomic and genetic material; cellular processes; nutrient signaling; and responses at the tissue level with bone and mus- cle as the tissues of interest. Changes in genomic and genetic material that are deemed to potentially associate with frailty include genome instability, epigenetic alterations, histone modifications, DNA methylation, DNA damage, and changes in chromatin structure. Cellular processes that are of interest to frailty pathways include: () processes that are key to maintaining the cell cycle cell senescence, stem-cell generation, and the pathways that involve p53, the protein tumor suppressor; () mechanisms involved in proteostasis (protein regulation); () mitochondrial processes involving dysfunction and disease; and () intercellular processes that involve inflam- mation and intercellular communication. The actions of the protein complexes proteasome, lysosome, and chaperone are considered in the network of pathways that regulate proteins. Putative pathways of nutrient sensing and signaling include pathways mediated by insulin signaling and mTor signaling, and the role of Ampk. The downloaded pathways were identified as putative frailty pathways when at least two () putative frailty biomarker genes were present among the genes that are involved in the pathway. This is applied from the follow- ing reasoning: if multiple genes that can possibly interact to express  phenotype are present in  pathway, then that pathway can be associated with that phenotype.

The NES is the enrichment score normalized based on the number of genes in the gene set. It indicates the rep- resentation of the pathway genes in the dataset gene list, which is priorly ranked according to the values of the -score of the genes. positive NES indicates that the pathway genes are mostly represented at the top of the gene list, while  negative NES indicates that the pathway genes are mostly represented at the bottom of the gene list. The plots of the NES of the different pathways for  given dataset are produced using ggplot2, and the heatmaps across different datasets or different genes are obtained using  complex heatmap   package87,88. Analysis on frailty biomarker genes and pathways  list of Frailty Biomarkers was generated from  survey of literature that was produced from studies that were inspired by the FRAILOMICS Initiative. The biomarker genes for mouse (Mus musculus) were obtained as  literal translation from human biomarker genes using biomaRt. Historically, frailty was assessed based on measuring functional phenotypic parameters. The Fried pheno- type regards frailty as  biological syndrome that comprises five components, .., shrinking, weakness, fatigue, slowness, and  low physical activity  level20; frailty is diagnosed when poor performance in three or more components are present. The Rockwood frailty index identifies frailty based on the accumulation of age-related deficits, including various symptoms, signs, functional impairments, and laboratory abnormalities; it is calcu- lated as the ratio of the number of accumulated deficits divided by the total number of deficits  measured20. The FRAILOMICS Initiative was introduced with the aim of developing validated measures comprising both classic and omics-based laboratory biomarkers. Since the inception of initiatives such as the  FRAILOMICS70,89,  number of approaches have been utilized to identify molecular biomarkers of frailty, among which are: the identification of differentially expressed biomark- ers based on the risk of  frailty89; the identification of genes regulated in  hallmarks of aging   pathways19; and the identification of molecular biomarkers that closely associate inflammatory mediators with  frailty35. In the publication by Durinck et al.89, subjects are stratified as frail or non-frail based on Fried  definition, and frailty biomarkers are identified as those that are upregulated in frail subjects. In the publication by Berrios et al.19, gene expression databases were searched to identify genes regulated in  hallmark of aging  pathways, namely () inflammation, () mitochondria and apoptosis, () calcium homeo- stasis, () fibrosis, () neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and neurons, () cytoskeleton and hormones. total of 44 biomarkers were evaluated based on differential expression. The markers were categorized by priority scores, with  higher priority score reflecting an upregulation of the biomarker in several pathways. In the publication by Lebrasseur et al.22,  meta-analysis was conducted with the aim of showing whether inflammatory mediators are overproduced in frail older adults. Forty-nine studies, published between 2002 and 2018 analyzing frailty and inflammation parameters, were selected for the meta-analysis. Among them, 35 studies (70%) associated frailty to CRP, 33 studies (66%) evaluated IL6, 13 studies (26%) reported data for TNF , and 12 (24%) analyzed other different inflammation biomarkers, including IL10, soluble TNF receptors  (sTNF-RI) and II (sTNF-RII), intercellular adhesion molecule  (ICAM-), monocyte chemoattractant protein- (MCP-), and IL6 receptor (IL6-). Regarding frailty identification, 92% of the studies employed Fried  frailty criteria, % of the studies used the frailty index developed by Rockwood and Mitnitski, and the remaining small percentage of studies employed tools and indicators recently described in the literature. In the work described in this paper, the authors have used the biomarker genes identified in the named studies as putative biomarker genes of frailty to conduct their analyses. The differential expression (log2foldchange and padj < .) of frailty biomarker genes were determined from the following two human datasets (OSD-52 and 195) and six mice datasets (OSD-21, 99, 101, 103, 104, 105). Subsequently, to generate the Venn diagram,  language v4..085 was used, through the library ggplot2 v3..087. It was extracted from the table of frailty genes (Table ), with genes unique to mice and humans, and with genes common for both (the intersections). After generating the diagram,  list of genes was extracted and manually added to the diagram. To generate the two upset plot graphs (for mice genes and human genes), the   language85 was also used, using the library ggplot2 v3..083 and ComplexUpset v1..590. Finally, to generate the heatmap, the python  v3.10. language was used, through the Seaborn v0.12. and Clustermap v0.11.12 libraries. Two heatmaps were generated (one for the mice genes and the other for the human genes), relating the genes to the respective OSD datasets. To complement the heatmap analyses,  dendrogram has also been added for each graph. Inspiration4 (i4) sample collection Inspiration4 was the world  first all-civilian mission to orbit Earth.

JAXA cell free epigenome (CFE) study RNA quantification data Aggregated RNA differential expression data and study protocols were shared through NASA  Open Science Data Repository with accession number: OSD-53039. Plasma cell-free RNA samples for RNA-seq analysis were derived from blood samples collected from  astronauts before, during, and after spaceflight on the ISS. Mean expression values were obtained from normalized read counts of  astronauts for each time point. Heatmaps were made for the frailty genes on the normalized values per time point using  package pheatmap version ..12. Quantification of genes associated with sarcopenia The curated short gene list of predictors of sarcopenia was obtained by analyzing  population of age matched individuals with and without sarcopenia using the expression superserie GSE111017. This list contains 21 genes that can predict sarcopenia in patients with an accuracy > 75%. The method for obtaining the gene list was per- formed as previously  described29. Here, we used GOstat 2022-11-03 on  version . to find enriched Biological Process and Molecular Function terms (Fig  and ). Using the obtained GO terms we found that some of the Frailty linked genes from JAXA CFE were also part of some of the same processes (Fig  and ). The figure was created using the GOplot package .. and modified to display the MAS for each gene. Finally, to determine the relevance of the shared 21 genes between all gene lists (Fig ), we assessed their expression in the mice data- sets OSD-99, OSD-101, OSD-103, OSD-104, and OSD-105. Finally, the heatmap was generated as before using python  v3.10. language, through the Seaborn v0.12. and Clustermap v0.11.12 libraries and  dendrogram has also been added for each graph. Metabolic flux simulation analysis We ran metabolic flux simulation on all available metabolic reactions for each RNA sequencing sample while applying our custom-made context-specific constraint-based metabolic modeling approach significantly updated  from23,94,95. This updated simulation model was constructed based on the RECON3D metabolic  model57 whose metabolic reactions were subsetted through  CORDA96 and  Cobrapy97 with gene-reaction-rule, where enzyme expression levels are linked to their corresponding metabolic reactions. For CORDA, flux confidence parameters ranging from  to  were decided as; () 55%, 25%, and 20% for OSD-91; (ii) 45%, 40%, and 15% for OSD-127, in order to minimize standard deviation of flux-levels across samples from each group for all groups. Also, several essential pathways such as  Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis ,  CoA Synthesis ,  CoA Catabolism ,  NAD Metabolism ,  Fatty Acid Synthesis ,  Fatty Acid Oxidation , and  Biomass and Maintenance Functions  were manually acti- vated for the simulation model stability. Note that  Oxidative Phosphorylation  and  Citric Acid Cycle  were not included in the essential pathways to take into account mitochondrial dysregulation. Our metabolic model ini- tially optimized for NAD biosynthesis whose capacity through all pathways of human was computed by estimat- ing optimized  NAD sink  reaction flux level where the sink was defined as large pools of metabolites importing metabolites from/to the system. Subsequently, optimization for all available reactions was conducted iteratively to compute flux levels of their corresponding reactions by Gurobi solver as LP whose reference manual can be found in https:// www. gurobi. com 98. While gene expression levels were applied into the model by each sample, the other parameters were maintained identically for all simulation, where an environment .., Jupyter notebook .. on Python .. was utilized. The simulation reported outcomes as flux levels of all available reactions through the custom-made flux balance analysis (FBA) analyses and the levels were analyzed as grouped variables for com- parison between  Flight  and  Ground  groups. Since it is hard to presume variance or normality between  Flight  and  Ground ,  non-parametric Van der Waerden (VdW) test was applied to properly compare their flux levels using the  matrixTests package (. ..). The comparison is illustrated as heatmaps with row-wise -scores on flux levels per each reaction in Fig. . Tabular data of metabolic flux analysis is shown in supplement . Data availability The RNA-seq data for the RR1 missions and the JAXA CFE data are available via the NASA Open Science Data Repository  (OSDR)  Biological Data Management Environment (https:// osdr. nasa. gov/ bio/ repo) with accession IDs: OSD-21, OSD-99, OSD-101, OSD-103, OSD-104, OSD-105 and OSD-530. For the Inspiration4 data, the data have been uploaded to two data repositories: the NASA Open Science Data Repository (osdr.nasa.gov; com- prised of NASA GeneLab and the NASA Ames Life Sciences Data Archive [ALSDA]), and the TrialX database. Identifiers for publicly downloadable datasets in the OSDR are documented below. Data can be visualized online through the SOMA Browser (https:// epige netics. weill. corne ll. edu/ apps/ I4_ Multi ome/), the single-cell browser (https:// soma. weill. corne ll. edu/ apps/ I4_ Multi ome/), and the microbiome browser (https:// soma. weill. corne ll. edu/ apps/ I4_ Micro biome/). For the PBMC data, the data are available with OSDR accession ID: OSD-570 and the following link: https:// osdr. nasa. gov/ bio/ repo/ data/ studi es/ OSD- 570/.

Many Rab-like proteins exist in plants, but only  subset have been functionally characterized. Results: Here we report that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c play important roles in pollen development, germination and tube elongation. AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants have no obvious morphological changes compared with wild-type plants across  variety of growth conditions. An AtrabD2b/2c double mutant is also indistinguishable from wild-type plants during vegetative growth; however its siliques are shorter than those in wild-type plants. Compared with wild-type plants, AtrabD2b/2c mutants produce deformed pollen with swollen and branched pollen tube tips. The shorter siliques in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were found to be primarily due to the pollen defects. AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have different but overlapping expression patterns, and they are both highly expressed in pollen. Both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c protein localize to Golgi bodies. Conclusions: These findings support  partially redundant role for AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in vesicle trafficking during pollen tube growth that cannot be fulfilled by the remaining AtRabD family members. Background Ras-like small GTP-binding proteins (GTPases) regulate diverse processes in eukaryotic cells including signal transduction, cell proliferation, cytoskeletal organization and intracellular membrane trafficking. GTPases are activated by GTP binding and inactivated by subsequent hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP, thus acting as mole- cular switches in these processes [,]. The Rab GTPase family is the largest and most complex within the Ras protein superfamily. Rab GTPases are important regula- tors of endomembrane trafficking, regulating exocytosis, endocytosis and membrane recycling processes in eukar- yotic cells [-]. Rab GTPase functions have been exten- sively studied in yeast and mammalian systems. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that different Rab proteins function in distinct intracellular membrane trafficking steps and they are hypothesized to work together with soluble -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor (SNARE) proteins to promote specificity of vesicle transport to target com- partments and facilitate vesicle and target membrane fusion [-13]. They are therefore essential for the trans- port of proteins and membrane through the endomem- brane system to their destination. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes 93 putative Ras superfamily proteins. Fifty-seven of these are Rab GTPases, more than in yeast but similar to the number in humans [13,14]. According to their sequence similar- ity and phylogenetic clustering with yeast and mamma- lian orthologs, these Rab proteins were assigned to eight subfamilies, AtRabA to AtRabH, which can be further divided into 18 subclasses [13]. Relatively few of the plant Rab orthologs have been investigated functionally. Most of these studies have used constitutively active (CA) and/or dominant negative (DN) mutations, gener- ated by direct mutation of the conserved domain to restrict mutant GTPase proteins to the active GTP- bound form (constitutively active) or inactive GDP- bound form (dominant negative).

DN Rab GTPases can perturb the activity of the endo- genous Rab, revealing their functional significance. For  number of plant Rab GTPases, expression of their CA and DN mutants in transformed plants, together with protein localization information, has shown that these Rabs perform functions similar to those of their yeast and mammalian orthologs [15-19]. Several reports indicate that Rab proteins are impor- tant for elongation of tip-growing cells in plants. For example, AtRabA4b is reported to localize to the tips of root hair cells and was proposed to regulate membrane trafficking through  compartment involved in the polarized secretion of cell wall components [18]. NtRab2 GTPase is important for trafficking between the endo- plasmic reticulum and Golgi bodies in tobacco pollen tubes and may be specialized to optimally support the high secretory demands in these tip growing cells [16]. NtRabA (Rab11) in tobacco is predominantly localized to an inverted cone-shaped region at the pollen tube tip, and both constitutively active and dominant negative mutants resulted in reduced tube growth rate, meander- ing pollen tubes, and reduced male fertility [20]. There are four genes in the Arabidopsis RabD subfam- ily, AtRabD1 (At3g11730), AtRabD2a (At1g02130, AtRab1b), AtRabD2b (At5g47200, AtRab1a) and AtRabD2c (At4g17530, AtRab1c) [13]. In mammals, the orthologs of AtRabD, Rab1 isoforms, physically associate with the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compartment and Golgi and regulate membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi complex [21]. Fluorescent protein fusions with AtRabD1, AtRabD2a and AtRabD2b localize to the Golgi and trans-Golgi network [22,23], and transient expression in plant cells of dominant negative mutants of rabD2a or rabD1 resulted in the inhibition of ER-to- Golgi trafficking [15,22,24], suggesting  related function for the plant Rab1 homologs. Pinheiro et al. [22] isolated -DNA insertion mutants in each of the AtRabD family genes and reported that each of the single and double mutants lacked  detectable phenotype. By contrast,  rabD2a rabD2b rabD2c triple mutant was lethal and  rabD1 rabD2b rabD2c triple mutant had stunted growth and low fertility, indicating that these gene family mem- bers perform important and overlapping functions. We previously hypothesized that closely related genes with  high Pearson correlation in their RNA accumulation level are functionally redundant, and showed that expression patterns of both the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c genes are negatively correlated with the process of starch synthesis [25], whereas the expression patterns of the remaining RabD genes are not. We therefore predicted that these two Rab proteins may have redundant functions that are not shared by the other two AtRabD family members. Here we show that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are highly correlated in their RNA accumulation level across  variety of experimen- tal conditions. Phenotypic analysis of knockout mutants indicates that they are at least partially func- tionally redundant, and are important in pollen devel- opment and pollen tube growth. The proteins both localize to the trans-Golgi, consistent with their pro- posed role in trafficking from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Results The expression patterns of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are closely correlated The four RabD family members in Arabidopsis share about 88% identity at the amino acid level. The accu- mulation pattern of the associated transcripts is quite distinct across  wide variety of experimental condi- tions and developmental stages (MetaOmGraph, http:// www.metnetdb.org/MetNet_MetaOmGraph.htm; [26]) (Table ; Additional file , Table S1). AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c expression patterns are correlated (at  Pearson correlation value of .72), whereas AtRabD1 and AtRabD2a show very low correlation with the others (Pearson correlation value of < .20). Based on their high sequence similarity (99% amino acid iden- tity) and the correlation between their mRNA accumu- lation patterns, we hypothesized that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c might have some functional overlap that is not shared by AtRabD1 and AtRabD2a. Identification of Null Mutations in the Genes AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c It was reported previously that an AtrabD2b AtrabD2c double mutant has no phenotype [22]. Based on our correlation analysis above, we hypothesized that this mutant may have some more subtle defects that cannot be compensated for by the remaining family members. To investigate this further, we identified -DNA inser- tion mutants (Figure 1A) in AtrabD2b ( alleles) and AtrabD2c ( allele). Homozygous lines for the -DNA insertions were identified by PCR, using primers selected by iSct primers ( mers..html), and the insertion sites were determined by sequencing the PCR products (Figure 1B). Analysis of mRNA levels by RT-PCR indicated that AtrabD2b-, AtrabD2b- and AtrabD2c- are null mutants. However, Table  Pearson correlation between expression patterns of AtRabD family members AtRabD1 AtRabD2a AtRabD2b AtRabD2c AtRabD1 100% AtRabD2a 17.08% 100% AtRabD2b -.% 22.19% 100% AtRabD2c 15.92% 25.23% 77.81% 100% Peng et al.

Progeny from AtrabD2b- and AtrabD2c- heterozy- gotes showed  -DNA segregation ratio of approxi- mately : based on kanamycin resistance, consistent with  single insertion. AtrabD2b- was supplied as  homozygous line. To generate AtrabD2b AtrabD2c dou- ble mutants, AtrabD2b- and AtrabD2c- homozygous single mutants were crossed, F1 plants were allowed to self fertilize and the AtrabD2b-/AtrabD2c- double mutant was identified from the F2 population by PCR using the primers for both AtrabD2b- and AtrabD2c-. Hereafter, the AtrabD2b-/AtrabD2c- double mutant will be referred to as AtrabD2b/2c, and AtrabD2b- and AtrabD2c- single mutants will be referred to as AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c respectively. Siliques Are Shorter in the AtrabD2b/2c Double Mutant than in Either Single Mutant or in Wild-Type Lines To evaluate phenotypes associated with the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutants, homozygous AtrabD2b (three alleles, AtrabD2b-, AtrabD2b- and AtrabD2b-), AtrabD2c and AtrabD2b/2c mutants, along with wild- type siblings, were grown on agar plates with or without various hormone, nutrient and light treatments. We tested over 50 of the conditions described in the Gantlet website ( however, no significant phenotypic differences were observed in the seedlings for any of the mutant alleles (data not shown). In addition, we tested the seedling phenotype on media with or with- out sucrose or vitamin B5 and, consistent with previous reports [22], no obvious phenotypes were observed. By contrast, AtrabD2b/2c double mutant lines showed  phenotype associated with reproduction. In these lines, siliques were shorter when grown either under continuous light or long day (16h light/8h dark) conditions. Neither the AtrabD2b nor the AtrabD2c single mutant alleles displayed  short silique pheno- type. The length of AtrabD2b/2c siliques was 70% of that of wild-type, AtrabD2b or AtrabD2c single mutant lines (Figure ;  < .01 by Student  -test). To evalu- ate whether this reduced silique size is associated with  seed defect, siliques from AtrabD2b/2c, wild-type, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutant lines were opened at 10 DAF (days after flowering). Consistently, no defects in the seeds of either AtrabD2b or AtrabD2c single mutants were observed. However, approximately half of the ovules in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were not fertilized (Figure ). Consistent with this observa- tion, the AtrabD2b/2c mutant plants produced  smal- ler quantity of seeds than wild-type plants or single mutants (Figure ; Additional file , Figure S1). These results are consistent with  functional overlap between AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c that cannot be ful- filled by AtRabD1 or AtRabD2a. Complementation of AtrabD2b/2c Mutant Phenotype To demonstrate that the AtrabD2b/2c mutant phenotype is due to the mutations in the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c genes, constructs containing either AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c, each expressed from their native promoter, were introduced into the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant.

AtrabD2b/2c, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c Pollen Have Defects in Morphology and Pollen Tube Elongation Two possibilities could explain the unfertilized embryos seen in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutants. One possibi- lity is that the pollen bears  defect that leads to pollen sterility and inability to fertilize the embryos. Alterna- tively, ovules may bear an abnormality such that their fertilization is reduced. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we observed the pollen by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). All of the pollen from wild- type plants looked normal, whereas more than 20% of the AtrabD2b/2c pollen exhibited an irregular, collapsed morphology (Figure 5A). We also observed that some abnormal pollen grains from the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were devoid of nuclei, as indicated by DAPI staining, whereas all pollen from wild-type (Figure 5B) and single mutant plants (data not shown) have nuclei. This defective pollen may be the severely collapsed pollen visualized under the SEM. Surprisingly, even the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutant lines produce aberrant pollen at  level of about 10%. This is unex- pected, as the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants have normal-appearing siliques and seed quantities simi- lar to the wild-type plants. likely explanation is that there are sufficient normal pollen grains in the single mutants to efficiently fertilize the ovaries in the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants. We originally identified AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c because the transcript accumulation patterns of these two genes correlate with those of many genes associated with starch metabolism. Indeed, the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant pollen stained less intensely with IKI than wild- type pollen (Figure 5C), suggesting  decreased starch content in the AtrabD2b/2c mutant pollen. This is con- sistent with the expression correlation, although the rea- son for this phenotype is unclear. single flower of Arabidopsis produces thousands of pollen grains, but usually there are less than 100 embryos in one silique. If only 20% of the pollen grains are abnormal, we would not expect the strikingly reduced fertility seen in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant. We therefore looked for additional explanations for the reduced fertility. To evaluate germination and Figure  There are many non-fertilized ovaries in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant.

After overnight incubation, almost all of the pollen from wild-type plants germinated and showed  typical tip growth. However, about 10% of the pollen from the AtrabD2b/2c mutant did not germinate at all and 50% of the pollen germinated but did not grow api- cally as did pollen of wild-type plants (Figure 6A and 6B). Instead, these pollen tubes were shorter and had swollen tips, some burst ( %), and others branched ( %; Figure 6A, and 6D). The germination rate of the pollen from the single mutants was similar to the wild- type pollen. However, approximately 20% of the germi- nating pollen also had swollen tips (Figure 6A and 6B), although the phenotype was not as severe as the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant; burst or branched tubes were never observed in either single mutant (Figure 6A and 6B). Moreover, the pollen tubes of the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant were much shorter than those of wild- type plants or either single mutant ( < .01), and the single mutants had shorter pollen tubes than wild-type plants (Figure 6E;  < .01 for both mutants). Even though the AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c single mutants had collapsed pollen, shorter pollen tubes and swollen tips, their siliques were normal compared with wild-type plants. We hypothesize that the single mutants may still have sufficient normal pollen to enable all embryos to be fertilized. The in vitro pollen germination phenotypes were confirmed by analyzing pollen tube growth after in vivo pollination (Figure 6C). Open flowers from wild- type or AtrabD2b/2c mutant plants were incubated overnight on agar medium. The AtrabD2b/2c mutant flowers had reduced pollen germination and decreased pollen tube length compared with wild-type plants, sug- gesting that pollen germination and pollen tube growth may also be defective in vivo. Pollen and Pollen Tube Defects Cause the Shorter Siliques in the AtrabD2b/2c Mutant To investigate whether the unfertilized seeds are due to the observed pollen abnormality, or whether the ovary also has defects that might contribute to the reduced rate of fertilization, we crossed wild-type and AtrabD2b/ 2c mutant plants. If the shorter silique phenotype is borne only by the abnormal pollen, wild-type plant pol- len should rescue the AtrabD2b/2c mutant silique phe- notype to  normal length (AtrabD2b/2c mutant female flower crossed with wild-type plant pollen). In contrast, the AtrabD2b/2c mutant plant pollen crossed with  wild-type female would mimic the mutant phenotype of decreased fertilization (wild-type female flower crossed with AtrabD2b/2c mutant pollen). Alternatively, if the ovary also has some abnormality, wild-type pollen would not completely rescue the mutant phenotype, and AtrabD2b/2c mutant pollen would not mimic the mutant phenotype. The results of these crosses indicated that pollen from wild-type plants can rescue the AtrabD2b/2c short silique phenotype, and the pollen from AtrabD2b/2c can bestow the shorter silique phe- notype on wild-type plants (Figures 7A and 7C). Specifi- cally, about half of the seeds were not fertilized in the siliques that developed from wild-type pistils fertilized by AtrabD2b/2c pollen (Figure 7B). In contrast, the sili- ques from AtrabD2b/2c usually had about 50% unferti- lized ovules, but when these pistils were fertilized by wild-type pollen, all seeds looked normal, and the sili- ques were longer than those siliques in the same inflor- escence which were self-fertilized (Figures ). These results confirm that the unfertilized ovaries are mostly, if not exclusively, caused by pollen defects in the AtrabD2b/2c mutant.

Public microarray data indicates that both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are expressed throughout development, including high expression in floral organs and particu- larly in the stamen (Figure ; [25,26]). To directly examine the spatial expression pattern of the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c genes, transgenic lines containing promoter:GFP/GUS constructs for each gene were analyzed for GUS activity at various stages of development from germination to senescence.

GUS staining further indicated that in cotyledons, rosette leaves and cauline leaves, AtRabD2b expression was localized predominantly in vascular tissues (Figure 9B), whereas AtRabD2c was expressed ubiquitously in cotyledons and in mature leaves throughout the entire leaf. Interestingly, in emerging leaves, AtRabD2c was only expressed in the trichomes, while AtRabD2b was not expressed in these cells (Figure 9A). In flowers, AtRabD2b was expressed in sepals, stamen and stigma, while AtRabD2c was expressed in sepal, stamen, stigma and style (Figure 9E, ). This dichotomy of expression suggests that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c may function independently of each other in certain cells.

They both also showed expression in roots, but AtRabD2b was ubi- quitously expressed throughout the root, while AtRabD2c expression was excluded from root hairs and root tips (Figure 9A-). Subcellular localization of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c In mammals, different AtRabD orthologs (Rab1 isoforms) are localized to the ER, ER-Golgi intermediate compart- ment or Golgi compartments. In plants, AtRabD2a and AtRabD2b are associated with the Golgi apparatus and trans-Golgi network [15,22,23,27], and we predicted that Figure  Temporal and spatial expression pattern of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c.

To determine the subcellular localization of AtRabD2c, GFP-AtRabD2b and GFP-AtRabD2c constructs were introduced into Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts and the GFP signal was observed by confocal microscopy. For both constructs, GFP localized to punctuate structures, reminiscent of the Golgi apparatus. To verify the identity of these structures, GFP-AtRabD2b and GFP-AtRabD2c were co-transfected into Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts with the trans-Golgi marker ST-YFP [15], and YFP and GFP signals were observed. Confocal results indicated that both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c primarily colocalized with ST-YFP (Figure 10) and are therefore associated with the Golgi, consis- tent with  role in Golgi trafficking. Occasionally, AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c-labeled structures were seen that did not contain ST-YFP; these could be the post- Golgi compartments described previously [22,23,27]. Cells expressing  single GFP or YFP fusion demon- strated the absence of cross talk between GFP and YFP signals (Additional file , Figure S2). Discussion Rab GTPases are critical players in the transport of materi- als through the endomembrane system, controlling exocy- tosis of proteins and cell wall materials, endocytosis of receptors and transporters, and membrane recycling pro- cesses. Together with SNARE proteins, they promote spe- cificity of vesicle transport to target compartments, ensuring that vesicles fuse only with their appropriate tar- get and thus maintaining the distinct identity of individual organelles. Two Rab subfamilies, Rab1 (AtRabD orthologs) and Rab2 (AtRabB orthologs), have been reported to func- tion in membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi in mammalian cells [21,28-34]. The plant Rab1 and Rab2 homologs AtRabD1, AtRabD2a and NtRab2 have also been reported to function in ER to Golgi vesicle transport [15,16]. Here, we demonstrate  distinct physiological role for the Rab1 homologs AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in pollen development and pollen tube growth. Using the bioinformatics tool MetaOmGraph (http:// www.metnetdb.org) [25,26] to determine the pairwise Pearsons correlation value between the expression pat- terns of all of the 57 AtRab genes (Additional file , Table S1), we found that among the four AtRabDs, only the expression of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are highly correlated. From this data, we hypothesized that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have partially redundant func- tions that are not shared by the remaining AtRabD family members. To test our hypothesis, we used - DNA insertion single and double mutants to confirm that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c have functional overlap and show that they are both required for normal pollen development and tip growth of pollen tubes. We also showed that they both co-localize with the trans-Golgi marker ST-YFP, consistent with their proposed role in Golgi trafficking. The conclusion that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are partially functionally redundant is based on several lines of evidence. First, although single mutant plants con- taining AtrabD2b or AtrabD2c mutant alleles are indis- tinguishable morphologically from their wild-type counterparts, even when grown under  variety of Figure 10 AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are both Golgi resident proteins. Arabidopsis leaf protoplasts were co-transformed with GFP-AtRabD2b or GFP-AtRabD2c and the Golgi marker ST-YFP. GFP, YFP and chlorophyll autofluorescence were detected by confocal microcopy. At least 10 transformed protoplasts were observed for each construct. Upper panel, GFP-AtRabD2b; lower panel, GFP-AtRabD2c. Scale bar = 10  . Peng et al. BMC Plant Biology 2011, 11:25  Page 12 of\n\ngrowth conditions, the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant has  short-silique phenotype. Second, both AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutant plants produce  small percentage of deformed and collapsed pollen grains, while AtrabD2b/ 2c lines produce  higher percentage of deformed pollen grains, many of which are severely deformed, some lack- ing nuclei. It is probable that such aberrant pollen would give rise to defects in pollen germination, and indeed, though the germination rate is similar between AtrabD2b or AtrabD2c single mutants and wild-type plants, about 10% of the pollen grains from AtrabD2b/ 2c double mutant plants are unable to geminate. Furthermore, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutant pollen tubes do not grow apically as well as do wild-type pollen tubes and tend to have swollen tips and  shorter length; this phenotype is substantially more severe in AtrabD2b/2c double mutants. In addition, some pollen tubes from AtrabD2b/2c double mutants branch or burst, which is not seen in pollen tubes of wild-type plants or either single mutant. These data also indicate that the loss of function of the AtRabD2b/2c genes can- not be compensated for by the AtRabD1 or AtRabD2a genes, suggesting that either some function() of the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c proteins are distinct from those of AtRabD1 or AtRabD2a, or that they are not expressed in the same cell types. Both AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c co-localize with the Golgi marker ST-YFP upon transient expression in Ara- bidopsis leaf protoplasts, as was reported also for AtRabD2a (formerly called AtRab1b) [15]. It is therefore possible that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c function in vesi- cle trafficking between the ER and Golgi apparatus, as does AtRabD2a [15,22]. Complete disruption of Rab function in ER-to-Golgi trafficking is expected to be lethal, due to loss of plasma membrane, vacuole and cell wall assembly and integrity. However, the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant is indistinguishable from wild-type plants, except for shorter siliques due to the pollen and pollen tube defects. There are several possible explanations for this. First, other AtRabs must perform the same function in vegetative tissue. The most likely candidates are AtRabD2a and AtRabD1, which could compensate for the loss of function in the AtrabD2b/2c mutant in most cell types [22]. Moreover, other Rab families, such as tobacco RabBs (NtRab2s) have also been shown to be regulators of membrane trafficking between the ER and Golgi apparatus [16]. AtRabBs (AtRab2s) may have the same function, such that they also participate in ER to Golgi vesicle trafficking. The pattern of AtRabB1b RNA accumulation is most highly correlated with that of AtRabD2b (67%) and AtRabD2c (68%) (Additional file , Table S1). These genes might compensate in part for the loss of function of AtrabD2b/2c. Second, pollen tubes grow very rapidly compared with many other cell types. Pollen tubes elongate by tip growth, whereby the pollen cytoplasm is confined to the most proximal region of the tube, and growth is restricted to the tube apex [35]. In vitro, lily pollen tubes grow at about 150 nm/sec [35] and Arabidopsis pollen tubes at 37 nm/sec [36]; in vivo, tobacco pollen can grow at 42 nm/sec [37]. This fast growth is contin- gent on rapid vesicle trafficking to deliver large amounts of membrane and cell wall components to the apical region of the tubes. This extensive trafficking require- ment may preclude the remaining Rabs from completely compensating for loss of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c. Third, computational analysis of public microarray data, together with studies of the expression pattern directed by the AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c promoters, indicated that both are widely expressed in most organs and several cell types, with high expression in pollen. Root hairs also showed expression of AtRabD2b, and, like pollen tubes, root hairs elongate by tip growth. However, root hair growth in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant is indistinguishable from that of wild-type plants. This is consistent with the idea that AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c are required for vesicle trafficking in multiple cell types, and that the highest demand for this process may be in pollen and pollen tubes, in order to optimally support the large secretory requirement of these very rapidly elongating cells. In combination, these data indicate that the high expression of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c in pollen may be important to facilitate membrane trafficking needed for pollen tube growth. Conclusions In summary, we used  -DNA insertion mutant approach to demonstrate the function of AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c. Our data indicated that both are Golgi resi- dents; they have similar but not identical expression patterns, but are both highly expressed in pollen; they are both involved in tip growth of pollen tubes; and they are at least partially functionally redundant. Future work will focus on elucidating the molecular basis for the pollen phenotype in the AtrabD2b/2c double mutant.

Pollen from AtrabD2b/2c, AtrabD2b and AtrabD2c mutants, along with pollen from wild-type plants, was germinated on agar medium containing 18% (/) sucrose, .01% (/) boric acid, 1mM MgSO4, 1mM CaCl2, 1mM Ca(NO3), and .% (/) agar, pH . [39] overnight at room temperature and examined and photographed under  Zeiss Axioplan II compound microscope equipped with an AxioCam color digital camera. Measurements were performed using SIS Pro software (OSIS, Lakewood, CO) using the bars in the ori- ginal image. For pollen tube length measurements, 200 pollen tubes were chosen randomly for each genotype, and significance was assessed using Student  -test. For fluorescence microscopy, the germinated pollen was transferred onto  slide and two drops of aniline blue solution (.005% aniline blue solution in . sodium phosphate, pH .) were added for ten minutes. To confirm the pollen tube growth defects, 20 open flowers per genotype were cut below the pistil and inserted vertically into germination medium in  -cm Petri dish. Plates were sealed and incubated overnight at 22  at 100% humidity under continuous illumination. The paths of pollen tubes inside the pistils were visualized by fixing whole pistils in % glutaraldehyde and % paraformalde- hyde in . sodium cacodylate buffer, pH ., under low vacuum (18 psi Hg) for   at room temperature. Samples were washed three times in the same buffer and stained with Aniline Blue and DAPI. The tissue was then cleared for 24 hours at room temperature with  drop of clearing solution (240  of chloral hydrate and 30  of gly- cerol in 90 ml water). Pollen was examined with  Zeiss Axioplan  light microscope (LM) and images were cap- tured with  Zeiss AxioCamHRc digital camera (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY) using AxioVision . soft- ware. The microscope was equipped with  DAPI filter set comprising an excitation filter (BP 365/12 nm),  beam splitter (395 nm), and an emission filter (LP 397 nm). The objectives used for imaging were  Neofluar 40  oil, an Apochromat 63  oil, and  Neofluar 100  oil. Cloning Promoter::GFP/GUS fusion constructs were made for each gene by cloning the amplified promoter region (intergenic region; 964 bp for AtRabD2b and 558 bp for AtRabD2c) into the binary vector pBGWFS7 (GATE- WAY; Invitrogen). The genomic fragments containing AtRabD2b or AtRabD2c with their respective promoters for comple- mentation of the mutant phenotype were amplified using AtRabD2b-- and  or AtRabD2c-- and  pri- mers (Table ).

Plant transformation and selection Arabidopsis plants were transformed using Agrobacter- ium tumefaciens by the floral dip method [40] and selected for Basta resistance conferred by the -DNA. Transcriptomic analysis MetaOmGraph (MOG;  [25] was used to analyze expression patterns of AtRabD1, AtRabD2a, AtRabD2b and AtRabD2c and derive the correlation between them. GUS assay Transgenic T2 seedlings were germinated in soil and har- vested at various stages of development. Plants or organs were stained at room temperature overnight as described [41], then destained in 70% (/) ethanol. For each con- struct, at least  independently transformed lines,  plants for each stage, were harvested for GUS screening. Transient expression in protoplasts Transient gene expression in Arabidopsis mesophyll protoplasts was carried out as described previously [42]. In brief, Arabidopsis protoplasts were isolated from the leaves of - week old plants. Leaf strips were digested in  buffer containing cellulose -10 and macerozyme -10. After adding 30   of plasmid DNA, an equal volume of protoplasts was mixed with PEG buffer (40% (/) PEG4000, 25% (/) .8M mannitol, 10% 1M CaCl2) then incubated at room temperature for 25 min. After gentle washing, the protoplasts were kept in the dark at room temperature overnight and then viewed by confocal laser scanning microscopy as described below. Confocal laser scanning microscopy Colocalization of GFP-RabD2b and GFP-RabD2c with ST-YFP was performed using  Leica TCS SP10 confo- cal microscope, which allows flexible selection of emis- sion bandwidths to minimize bleed-through. Transformed cells were excited with  488 nm laser (power 20%) and 514 nm laser (50% power), and GFP and YFP signals were collected using 495-510 nm and 560-640 nm bandwidths, respectively. Non-transformed cells and cells expressing  single GFP or YFP fusion were used as controls to confirm the absence of cross talk between GFP, YFP and autofluorescence signals. Scanning electron microscopy Pollen that had been germinated in vitro was placed in % glutaraldehyde and % paraformaldehyde in . sodium cacodylate buffer, pH ., under low vacuum (18 psi Hg) for   at room temperature. Samples were washed three times in the same buffer, postfixed in % osmium tetroxide in the same buffer for   and washed two times in the same buffer, followed by deionized water. Samples were dehydrated through  graded etha- nol series (50, 70, 85, 95, and 100%; 30 min per step), followed by two changes of ultrapure 100% ethanol, all 30 min per step. Fresh pollen was also examined with- out fixing. Fixed samples were critical point-dried in  DCP- Denton critical-point-drying apparatus (http:// www.dentonvacuum.com) using liquid carbon dioxide, and mounted on aluminum stubs with double-sided sticky pads and silver cement. Samples were then sputter-coated with 15 nm gold (20%) and palladium (80%) in  Denton Vacuum LLC Desk II Cold Sputter Unit ( com), and viewed with  JEOL 5800LV SEM ( jeol.com) at 10 kV. Alternatively, released fresh pollen grains were directly mounted on stubs and sputter-coated with gold particles before SEM analysis. All digitally col- lected images including the LM and SEM images were processed in Adobe PhotoShop . and made into plates using Adobe Illustrator 10. Over 20 samples from each plant line were used for SEM or LM analysis. Additional material Additional file : Table S1. Expression pattern of AtRab genes.

This phenomenon, called gravitropism, is in uenced by most of the major plant hormones including brassinosteroids. Epi-brassinolide (eBL) was previously shown to enhance root gravitropism,  phenomenon similar to the response of roots exposed to the actin inhibitor, latrunculin  (LatB). This led us to hypothesize that eBL might enhance root gravitropism through its effects on  lamentous-actin (-actin). This hypothesis was tested by comparing gravitropic responses of maize (Zea mays) roots treated with eBL or LatB. LatB- and eBL-treated roots displayed similar enhanced downward growth compared with controls when vertical roots were oriented horizontally. Moreover, the effects of the two compounds on root growth directionality were more striking on  slowly-rotating two- dimensional clinostat. Both compounds inhibited autotropism,  process in which the root straightened after the initial gravistimulus was withdrawn by clinorotation. Although eBL reduced -actin density in chemically- xed . mays roots, the impact was not as strong as that of LatB. Modi cation of -actin organization after treatment with both compounds was also observed in living roots of barrel medic (Medicago truncatula) seedlings expressing genetically encoded -actin reporters. Like in  xed . mays roots, eBL effects on -actin in living . truncatula roots were modest compared with those of LatB. Furthermore, live cell imaging revealed  decrease in global -actin dynamics in hypocotyls of etiolated . truncatula seedlings treated with eBL compared to controls. Collectively, our data indicate that eBL-and LatB-induced enhancement of root gravitropism can be explained by inhibited autotropic root straightening, and that eBL affects this process, in part, by modifying -actin organization and dynamics.

Front. Plant Sci. 11:. doi: 10.3389/fpls.2020.00005 ORIGINAL RESEARCH published: 04 February 2020 doi: 10.3389/fpls.2020. INTRODUCTION Plants are sessile organisms that are limited by their location. As such, they have evolved sensitive and delicate ways to respond to environmental cues allowing them to reprogram their growth when presented with changes in their surroundings. One of the adaptive behaviors that plants exhibit in response to external signals is the ability to redirect the growth of their major organs towards or away from  perceived stimulus. These phenomena, collectively called tropisms, shape the above and belowground architecture of the plant. One of the most widely studied tropisms is gravitropism, which describes the growth of shoots and roots away or toward the gravity vector, respectively. Gravity perception occurs in the columella cells located in the root cap or endodermal cells in shoots. Columella and endodermal cells contain starch- lled amyloplasts, called statoliths, which sediment to the lower side of the cell when the plant is reoriented relative to the gravity vector (Sack, 1997; Tasaka et al., 1999; Kiss, 2000). The physical signal triggered by statolith sedimentation is transduced to the growing regions of the organ resulting in differential growth between the upper and lower sides (Blanca or and Masson, 2003; Sato et al., 2015). Plant organs typically have  de ned gravitropic set point angle (GSA). Although the GSA of  speci  organ is in uenced by the developmental stage of the plant and other environmental cues, it is under tight genetic control allowing for the maintenance of  de ned growth angle relative to gravity when other external signals are kept constant. For instance, under carefully controlled laboratory conditions, the main shoot axis typically grows vertically upward (negative gravitropism) with  GSA of 180  and the primary root grows vertically downward (positive gravitropism) with  GSA of  . Lateral roots and shoot branches typically have  GSA between these values (Firn and Digby, 1997). Recently, mechanisms underlying GSA of plant organs that exhibit non-vertical growth, such as lateral roots and shoot branches, have been shown to be dependent on auxin and plant nutritional status (Roychoudhry et al., 2013; Roychoudhry et al., 2017). Most studies on gravitropism have focused on understanding biological processes that lead to the initial redirection of organ growth when the plant is reoriented. However, gravitropism has been viewed as  composite response that includes restrained or anti-gravity growth readjustment in which the organ eventually straightens after the initial growth redirection. The latter phenomenon is known as autotropic straightening or autotropism (Stankovic et al., 1998a; Stankovi  et al., 1998b). Although it is well established that the initial gravitropic response (.. downward root growth and upward shoot growth) is modulated by auxin redistribution (Swarup et al., 2001; Rakusova et al., 2015), there is accumulating evidence that most of the major plant hormones participate in gravitropism through overlapping signaling pathways (Guisinger and Kiss, 1999; Lofke et al., 2013; Vandenbussche et al., 2013; Pernisova et al., 2016). By contrast, little is known about the underlying mechanisms regulating autotropism. It has been debated whether induction of autotropic straightening is triggered by gravity itself (Myers et al., 1995) or as an autonomic counter response to gravitropic bending (Tarui and Iino, 1999; Bastien et al., 2013; Okamoto et al., 2015). It has also been suggested that the term autotropism should be used exclusively in situations when plant organs straighten after withdrawal of the gravity stimulus through randomization of the gravity vector on  clinostat or in microgravity (Stankovi  et al., 1998b). The cytoskeleton has been proposed to play major roles in all phases of gravitropism (Blanca or, 2002; Bisgrove, 2008). Microtubules and  lamentous-actin (-actin) are the core protein components of the cytoskeleton, and their dynamics and higher order organization within the cell are de ned by many regulatory proteins (Blanca or, 2013). Most studies implicating the cytoskeleton in gravitropism have employed pharmacological approaches in which roots or shoots were exposed to cytoskeletal inhibitors, and the subsequent response of the organ to  horizontal reorientation was quanti ed (Blanca or, 2002). Interestingly, such approaches have revealed that chemical inhibitors of -actin such as latrunculin  (LatB) or cytochalasin  can elicit stronger gravitropic responses in shoots and roots (Blanca or and Hasenstein, 1997; Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002; Blanca or et al., 2003; Hou et al., 2003; Hou et al., 2004). The stronger gravitropic response of roots and shoots after treatment with -actin antagonists was recapitulated in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants disrupted in vegetative actin isoforms (Kato et al., 2010; Lanza et al., 2012). Furthermore, the . thaliana shoot gravitropic response9 (sgr9) mutant, which had reduced shoot gravitropism and statolith sedimentation, could be rescued by LatB treatment (Nakamura et al., 2011). Recently, delayed root gravitropism in . thaliana actin-related protein  (arp3) mutants was linked to abnormal amyloplast sedimentation and bundled -actin in the columella cells. The delay in root gravitropism was reversed by LatB exposure (Zhou et al., 2016). It was postulated that actin disruption promoted gravitropism by increasing gravity sensing potential through unimpeded statolith sedimentation (Blanca or, 2013). However, this hypothesis remains to be tested experimentally. As noted, gravitropism is modulated by most of the major plant hormones, but in the context of past actin inhibitor studies, brassinosteroid is the plant hormone that is of most interest. Like LatB, eBL promoted gravitropism in shoots and roots (Meudt, 1987; Kim et al., 2000; Li et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2007; Lanza et al., 2012). The effect of eBL on root gravitropism was explained primarily through its interaction with auxin (Kim et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2007). In . thaliana, eBL induced the accumulation of the auxin ef ux carrier PIN-FORMED  (PIN2) protein in the root elongation zone (Li et al., 2005). The effect of eBL on PIN2 accumulation was proposed to involve the actin cytoskeleton through an increase in the expression domains of ROP2 (for Rho of Plants),  small GTPase regulator of -actin dynamics (Li et al., 2005). Furthermore, it was shown that exogenous eBL treatment altered both actin organization and PIN2 polar localization in . thaliana roots in  manner similar to that of auxin (Lanza et al., 2012). Taken together, the actin cytoskeleton appears to be  component of the signaling pathways by which eBL promotes gravitropic growth responses in plants. de Bang et al. Brassinosteroids Modulate Root Autotropism Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org February 2020 | Volume 11 | Article\n\nThe promotive effect of LatB and eBL on gravitropism has been explained primarily in regard to their impact on gravity sensing events or on the differential growth responses resulting from altered auxin redistribution (Hou et al., 2003; Hou et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005; Lanza et al., 2012; Blanca or, 2013). However,  recent study with . thaliana mutants disrupted in genes encoding the actin motor protein myosin presents an alternative hypothesis to explain the LatB- or eBL-induced enhancement of root gravitropism. The apparent promotion of tropistic organ responses brought about by altered actin function may instead be due to its inhibition of the autotropic straightening response (Okamoto et al., 2015). In the study by Okamoto et al. (2015), in orescence stems of . thaliana myosin XI mutants bent strongly when the initial gravity stimulus was withdrawn by clinorotation, an observation that mirrored the persistent curvature of . mays roots treated with LatB (Hou et al., 2003). Here, we show that eBL-treated roots exhibited persistent curvature responses when the initial gravity response was withdrawn by clinorotation in  similar manner as LatB- treated roots. Our results indicate that the apparent promotion of root gravitropism by eBL can be explained by its inhibitory effect on autotropic straightening that resulted, in part, from eBL- mediated alterations in -actin dynamics and organization. MATERIALS AND METHODS Zea mays Root Growth and Drug Treatments Maize (Zea mays . cultivar Merit) seeds were soaked for 10 to 12  in deionized water. After soaking, seeds were planted side by side with the embryo facing down on 45   35 cm opaque plastic trays lined with moist germination paper (Seedburo Equipment Co. USA). The seeds were covered with  second layer of germination paper and gentle pressure was applied to the paper so that surface tension between the two sheets of paper held the seeds in place. second opaque plastic tray was placed on top of the  rst tray so that the two layers of germination paper containing the seeds were secured between the two trays. The trays were oriented vertically in  plastic tub  lled with water to  depth of  10 cm to keep the germination paper moist. After 48 , seedlings with   cm long straight primary roots were selected and treated with working solutions of LatB, eBL or the corresponding solvent control, which consisted of diluted dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). To treat roots,  set-up consisting of . ml microfuge tubes oriented vertically on microfuge holders was prepared. The center of the lid of the microfuge tube was punctured with the tip of  heated metal probe to create   mm diameter hole, and  ml of the treatment solution was added to each tube. Selected seedlings were transferred one at  time to each microfuge tube by inserting the roots into the hole so that 20 mm of the root tip was immersed vertically in the solution.",

The lid of the Petri dish was lined with two layers of wet germination paper (Seedburo Equipment Co., USA) to maintain high humidity. The Petri dishes were sealed with para lm and mounted on  custom-built two-dimensional (-) clinostat located in the same Conviron growth chamber (Controlled Environments Ltd, Canada) used for seed germination and root treatment. The Petri dishes were  rst mounted so that the roots were vertical (Appendix ). After 60 min the Petri dishes were rotated by 90  so that roots were in  horizontal position. After 20 min, the clinostat was activated and roots were rotated for 20  at  revolution per minute (RPM). Digital images of the roots after clinorotation were captured using  camera mounted on  copy stand. Each treatment was replicated three times using  total of 15 20 seedlings.

After mounting sections on glass slides, they were imaged with an inverted Leica TCS- SP8- confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany) equipped with  63  oil-immersion objective. Alexa- Fluor was excited with the 488 nm line of the white light laser and emission was detected at 522 nm. To enhance the resolution of -actin images obtained from  xed roots for downstream quantitative analysis, the HyVolution deconvolution package (Huygens, The Netherlands) was used to process image data directly acquired with the Leica SP8- system. Five optical sections taken at . mm intervals were acquired. Each dataset was then processed using the wizard-driven HyVolution user interface linked with the Leica Application Suite (LAS) software.

The infection procedure included  10-min vacuum in ltration,    min sonication and then another 10-min vacuum in ltration. After this, the infected leaves were blot dried and plated on co-cultivation medium. The trifoliate explants were transferred onto selection medium containing 10 mg ml- hygromycin after 24 30  incubation under 24  in the dark. Culture of the explants continued for an additional   weeks under the same conditions or until enough resistant calli were produced. The resistant calli were then transferred onto shoot regeneration medium and cultured under 150 mmoles - - light at 24/20   and 16/  day/night cycle. After   months, plantlets were fully regenerated with functional roots. couple of lea ets were sampled from the regenerated plants for DNA extraction. Genomic DNA was extracted using cetyl trimethylammonium bromide. DNA samples were PCR ampli ed with primers for hygromycin  phosphotransferase gene (forward  - AAGGAATCGGTCAATACACTACATGG -  and reverse  - AAGACCAATGCGGAGCATATACG - ). Con rmed transgenic plants were then screened using   uorescent stereo microscope and those with GFP signal were transferred to soil and allowed to go to seed. Multiple, independent lines of both UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP, and UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP were screened in the subsequent generations until homozygous positive lines were obtained. Growth Characterization of . truncatula -Actin Reporter Lines Seeds of both reporter lines and wild type (R108) were scari ed in concentrated sulfuric acid for  min, washed with cold water, and then surface sterilized for  min in  solution containing 30% commercial bleach and .% Tween-20. After decanting the bleach solution, the seeds were rinsed and stored overnight in the dark at room temperature. The seeds were placed onto sterile, moist  lter paper in Petri dishes and strati ed at   in the dark for  days and then transferred to  growth chamber at 22  and 16/  day/night (modi ed from Boisson-Dernier et al. (2001). After germinating, seedlings were transferred to square agar plates supplemented with   Murashige and Skoog medium. The plates were moved back to the growth chamber and positioned vertically to allow the roots to elongate on the agar media surface. The root tip of at least 16 plants per genotype was marked with  black dot. This process was repeated two times every 24  for  total of  days. ImageJ was used to measure the average root elongation per day and this measurement was used as an indicator of the root growth rate. Plants were allowed to grow for four more days in plates, for  total of  days. The plates were imaged and RootNav software (University of Nottingham, UK) was used to automatically measure the primary root length (Pound et al., 2013). The plants were then transferred to pots  lled with  mixture of turface and vermiculite (:), and then grown at 22  and 16/  day/night for three more weeks, for  total of 28 days of growth. After this time, the plants were removed from the pots and the soil mixture was washed away from the roots. Roots and shoots were separated, bagged, and dried at 65  for one week, before obtaining shoot and root dry weight.

RESULTS Epi-Brassinolide-Treated . mays Roots Exhibit Persistent Curvature on  Slowly Rotating Clinostat and Enhanced Gravitropism Previous reports have shown that LatB and eBL promoted gravitropism in roots (Hou et al., 2003; Hou et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2007; Lanza et al., 2012). The enhancement of gravitropic response in LatB-treated roots was more strongly manifested on  slowly-rotating - clinostat. For instance, . mays roots treated with LatB displayed persistent root curvature on the clinostat, as opposed to untreated roots that straightened (Hou et al., 2003). We hypothesized that the enhanced gravitropism of eBL-treated roots was likely to also be more prominent under clinorotation. Our experiment involved applying  perpendicular gravistimulus to roots for 20 min after pre-treating them for an hour with LatB or eBL followed by clinorotation for 20  (Appendix ). We found that eBL-treated roots mirrored the persistent curvature responses of LatB-treated roots (Figure 1A; Hou et al., 2003). Quanti cation of the angle of root curvature that developed on the clinostat revealed that LatB was more potent than eBL when tested at the same concentrations. For instance, LatB induced  strong curvature response at 100 nM concentration, whereas eBL elicited  similar curvature at  higher 500 nM concentration (Figure 1B). Next, we compared the kinetics of gravitropism of . mays roots pretreated for   with 100 nM LatB or 500 nM eBL under de Bang et al.

We found that roots treated with the solvent control solution grew downward and reached  maximum angle of about 80  from the horizontal at approximately 200 min. Control roots maintained this angle for the entire 720 min time course. By contrast, LatB- and eBL- treated roots overshot the vertical and reached maximum angle of approximately 110  after 250 min (Figure 1C). Overshooting of the vertical by LatB- and eBL- treated roots was followed by  correction to the vertical that began at about 300 min after orienting roots horizontally. Although both LatB- and eBL- treated roots exhibited similar kinetics with regard to their overshooting of the vertical, the subsequent overcorrection was more pronounced in eBL-treated roots. eBL-treated roots returned to an angle of about 60  at 450 min after gravistimulation, but eventually stabilized to  90  growth angle by about 600 min. At the end of the 720 min time course, eBL-treated roots reached  similar angle as controls. By contrast, LatB-treated roots returned to about 90  at 450 min and maintained this growth angle for the duration of the time course (Figure 1C). Epi-Brassinolide Modi es -Actin Organization in . mays Roots The similar effects of LatB and eBL on maize root gravitropism and autotropic root straightening on  - clinostat (see Figure ) led us to hypothesize that eBL may cause LatB-like effects on the actin cytoskeleton. To test this hypothesis, we studied -actin organization in maize roots that were treated with LatB and eBL at concentrations that produced comparable root phenotypes (..100 nM for LatB and 500 nM for eBL). After exposure to the compounds, roots were chemically  xed, sectioned and -actin was labeled with phalloidin conjugated to   uorophore (Dyachok et al., 2016). Consistent with our previous studies (Hou et al., 2003), distinct qualitative differences in -actin organization were observed between roots treated with solvent FIGURE  | Epi-Brassinolide (eBL) and LatB enhanced gravitropism and dampened straightening of . mays roots.

Whereas controls had extensive -actin networks in various root developmental zones, LatB-treated roots had diffuse labeling or severely fragmented -actin manifested primarily as bright puncta (Figure 2A). By contrast, roots treated with 500 nM eBL still had abundant -actin networks in the various root developmental zones that appeared similar to control roots. Since roots treated with 500 nM eBL did not show obvious qualitative differences in -actin organization compared with control roots, we increased the eBL treatment concentration to  and   . Nonetheless, even after treatment with    eBL, - actin in various regions of the root appeared similar to untreated roots. Qualitative disruptions to -actin only became obvious when eBL concentration was increased to   . At this concentration some root cells had diffuse  uorescence and fragmented -actin that resembled LatB-treatment to some degree (Figure 2A). However, unlike LatB-treated roots, roots treated with    eBL contained more cells with intact -actin networks that were similar to untreated roots. This result suggested that while eBL disrupts actin, its effects were milder than LatB. To quantify the effect of LatB and eBL on the root -actin networks, we acquired occupancy values from images of root FIGURE  | Epi-Brassinolide (eBL) modi ed -actin organization in . mays roots.

Occupancy is  quantitative metric used to depict -actin density with higher values indicating  denser - actin network (Higaki et al., 2010b). Compared with controls, occupancy of -actin in roots treated with 100 nM LatB, 500 nM eBL, and    eBL was lower. Surprisingly, -actin occupancy was signi cantly higher in roots treated with    eBL compared to control roots (Figure 2B). Taken together, our results show that eBL modi es -actin organization in maize roots by causing  signi cant reduction in density. However, unlike roots treated with LatB, which showed more widespread disruption of -actin, roots treated with eBL required higher concentrations (.. ) to detect distinct qualitative and quantitative effects on -actin structure. Even at this higher concentration, impacts on -actin appeared to be localized to random regions of the root (Figure 2A). Another metric that we used to quantify eBL effects on -actin structure is skewness, which measures the degree of asymmetry of  uorescence intensity distribution. Skewness has been shown to be  good indicator of -actin bundling (Higaki et al., 2010a). We found that while LatB treatment resulted in  small but signi cant increase in bundling, eBL at all concentrations, did not (Figure 2C). Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP Reporters Decorate Extensive -Actin Networks in Living . truncatula Seedlings Our studies on chemically- xed roots of . mays, support the hypothesis that the effects of eBL on root gravitropism and autotropic straightening on  - clinostat are due to disruptions in normal actin function (Figures  and ). However, the results indicate that eBL only had modest effects on overall -actin organization based on qualitative and quantitative analyses of chemically- xed . mays roots (Figures 2A ). Therefore, we next asked if effects of eBL on -actin would be more obvious in living roots. To address this question, transgenic . truncatula plants that expressed two live cell -actin reporters (Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP) under the control of the ubiquitin 10 (UBQ10) promoter were generated (Wang et al., 2008; Vidali et al., 2009; Dyachok et al., 2014; Sparks et al., 2016). Before using the lines for clinorotation assays, we  rst examined the quality of -actin labeling in seedling roots. We found that Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP decorated extensive -actin networks in various developmental regions of seedling roots. Distinct - actin arrays were present in border cells, meristematic cells and cells in the transition/elongation zone. Similar to previous reports in . thaliana, both Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2- GFP reporters labeled end walls and phragmoplasts in the meristem, and random and longitudinal -actin cables in the elongation zone of . truncatula seedling roots (Figure 3A). In agreement with previously published work with  xed and living roots, both reporters did not label distinct -actin networks in the columella despite the presence of clear -actin bundles in the peripheral cap and border cells. Only diffuse  uorescence was observed in the central columella of both reporter lines (Figure 3A; Baluska et al., 1997; Blanca or, 2013). Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP also labeled extensive -actin arrays in growing root hairs that were reminiscent of -actin organization in . thaliana lines expressing these two reporters (Figure 3B; Dyachok et al., 2014; Sparks et al., 2016). Moreover, other cell types in transgenic lines expressing GFP-ABD2-GFP and Lifeact- mGFP including guard cells, minor leaf veins and epidermal cells in nodules exhibited dense -actin arrays (Figures 3C ). Although primary root length and growth rate of -day-old . truncatula seedlings expressing Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2- GFP were similar to wild type (Figures 3F, ), dry weights of the same lines at 28 days were lower compared to wild type (Figures 3H, ). Epi-Brassinolide Triggers Enhanced Root Curvature Responses in . truncatula on  Clinostat, But Only Had Mild Effects on -Actin Organization We next asked if eBL could elicit similar enhancement of root curvature responses in . truncatula on  clinostat that was previously observed in . mays roots (Figure ). As  mM eBL was required to observe clear effects on -actin in chemically-  xed . mays roots (Figure ), we used the same concentration for the . truncatula clinostat assays. Furthermore, we focused our clinostat assays on lines expressing GFP-ABD2-GFP. The GFP-ABD2-GFP lines were chosen for our root clinostat assays because -actin in the transition and elongation zone was  ner and less bundled compared to Lifeact-mGFP lines, an observation consistent with previous work on . thaliana (Dyachok et al., 2014). Consistent with previous reports, LatB- treated . truncatula roots expressing GFP-ABD2-GFP exhibited enhanced curvature on  clinostat (Figures 4A, ; Hou et al., 2003). Like in . mays roots, eBL treatment caused . truncatula roots to curve strongly on  clinostat (Figures 4A, ). Although, enhanced curvature on  clinostat was observed in LatB- and eBL-treated . truncatula roots, the  nal average curvature was less than that observed in . mays (Compare Figure  and Figure ). Having established that . truncatula roots expressing the GFP-ABD2-GFP -actin reporter exhibited enhanced curvature on  clinostat, we then asked if -actin organization in living roots was modi ed by eBL. We focused our analyses on root cells within the transition and elongation zone. Consistent with observations in chemically- xed . mays roots, -actin in . truncatula roots expressing UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP was clearly disrupted after treatment with 100 nM LatB. While root epidermal cells in the elongation zone of untreated roots had extensive cortical -actin networks, -actin in the same region after   exposure to 100 nM LatB were less dense and fragmented (Figure 5A). Moreover, -actin in live . truncatula roots treated with LatB had lower occupancy values, which corroborated results with chemically  xed . mays roots (Figure 5B). Experiments with eBL were less conclusive, de Bang et al. Brassinosteroids Modulate Root Autotropism Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org February 2020 | Volume 11 | Article\n\nparticularly with regard to the impact on -actin density. Surprisingly, -actin in roots treated with    eBL had intact cortical -actin networks that were qualitatively similar to untreated roots (Figure 5A). Quantitative analysis showed that -actin occupancy values were consistent with the observation that    eBL had no signi cant effects on -actin density in living roots (Figure 5B). Furthermore, while -actin skewness increased in LatB-treated roots, this metric was not affected by    eBL (Figure 5C). Next, we asked if eBL had other measurable quantitative impacts on -actin organization in living . truncatula roots. For this analysis, the degree of orientation of -actin in root cell images was analyzed using  metric called eccentricity. Lower eccentricity values indicate  more disordered -actin network. Modi ed cortical -actin eccentricity was reported in Physcomitrella patens ROP4 RNA interference (RNAi) lines (Burkart et al., 2015). Using metrics developed by Burkhart et al. (2015), we found that -actin in living . truncatula roots treated with 100 nM LatB and    eBL had signi cantly lower eccentricity values than -actin in untreated roots. This result indicated that both LatB and eBL treatments led to more disordered -actin (Figure 5D).

For these experiments, epidermal cells of etiolated barrel medic seedlings expressing UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP were used for analyzing -actin dynamics. We used lines expressing UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP for these analyses because the -actin arrays in hypocotyls of these lines were more readily visualized than those expressing UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP. Roots were not used for this analysis because they grew out of the  eld of view within the desired  min period required for global actin dynamics analysis. Furthermore, the thick roots from . truncatula were dif cult to keep in the same focal plane during imaging, which complicated the interpretation of results. Cortical -actin in . truncatula hypocotyls were captured every second for  min and movies were used to quantify global changes in -actin following the metrics developed by Vidali et al. (2010) (Supplemental Movies S1 and S2). These metrics included pixel difference values that capture intensity differences between images every second, and correlation coef cients that indicate the degree of change (Figures 6A, ). larger difference between pixels over time and  steeper decay in the correlation coef cient indicated  more dynamic -actin network (Vidali et al., 2010; Dyachok et al., 2014; Burkart et al., 2015). The - actin network in epidermal cells of eBL-treated etiolated . truncatula hypocotyls had lower intensity difference values and  more gradual decay of the correlation coef cient compared to solvent control seedlings (Figures 6C, ). Taken together, these data imply that eBL treatment suppressed -actin dynamics in etiolated . truncatula hypocotyls. DISCUSSION In this paper,  slowly-rotating - clinostat was used to gain additional insights into actin-mediated regulation of directional root growth. These experiments showed that brassinosteroids were involved in modulating directional root growth, in part, by modifying the organization and dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton. This conclusion was based on the observation that exogenous application of eBL and LatB triggered similar enhanced root gravitropism and ampli ed root coiling on  clinostat (Figure ). The curvature responses of roots treated with eBL and LatB during continuous gravistimulation and on  clinostat are reminiscent of the behavior of in orescence stems of . thaliana myosin XI and actin8 mutants (Kato et al., 2010; Okamoto et al., 2015; Talts et al., 2016). The hyperbending of in orescence stems of myosin and actin . thaliana mutants was proposed to be the result of inhibited autotropism.

Here, we propose that  similar mechanism may be operating in roots, and that eBL is  component of the root organ straightening response through its impacts on -actin. Most of the studies implicating the actin cytoskeleton in gravitropism have emphasized its role in the gravity perception phase (Blanca or, 2013; Su et al., 2017). In gravity sensing cells such as the columella, actin has been proposed to interact with amyloplasts to facilitate conversion of the physical gravity signal to  biochemical signal (Zheng et al., 2015). Because actin inhibitors such as LatB or mutations to genes encoding actin itself led to stronger root gravitropic curvature (Yamamoto and Kiss, 2002; Hou et al., 2003; Kato et al., 2010; Lanza et al., 2012), it was proposed that the unrestrained sedimentation of amyloplasts may amplify the gravity sensing signal leading to  more robust graviresponse (Blanca or, 2013). However, work on . thaliana myosin XI mutants (Okamoto et al., 2015) and results presented here, suggest  more prominent role for actin in the graviresponse phase, and more speci cally in the autotropic straightening response that enables plant organs to correct their orientation (Stankovic et al., 1998a; Stankovi  et al., 1998b). Furthermore, given the dif culties in obtaining clear images of -actin in the columella (Figure ), we cannot rule out the possibility that  secondary mechanism of gravity sensing in the root transition zone might be affected by LatB (Wolverton et al., 2002). number of studies have implicated eBL in directional root growth control. For instance, eBL application mirrored the enhanced root waving and gravitropism of . thaliana actin2 mutants and caused disruptions in -actin con gurations in wild type (Lanza et al., 2012). Enhanced root gravitropism was also observed in wild-type . thaliana roots treated with eBL and this process was proposed to be mediated by ROP2-dependent modi cation of -actin assembly and disassembly (Li et al., 2005). While our results expand on these previous observations, experiments with  clinostat implicated eBL as  potential regulator of autotropism, and like previous results with LatB-treated roots, provide an alternative explanation of why this hormone has an apparent promotive effect on gravitropism. Although previous studies have shown that eBL modi es - actin organization in . thaliana roots (Lanza et al., 2012), we found that eBL effects on -actin organization in  xed . mays FIGURE  | -actin organization in epidermal cells of living . truncatula roots expressing UBQ10:GFP-ABD2-GFP after   exposure to LatB or eBL.

Higher concentrations of eBL were needed to elicit distinct qualitative and quantitative changes in -actin in both chemically- xed . mays roots and living . truncatula roots. In fact, it was surprising to  nd that    eBL led to increased -actin occupancy values compared to controls, while concentrations lower (500 nM) or higher (  ) than    led to reduced values (Figure 2B). Moreover, -actin occupancy and bundling in living roots treated with    eBL was not different from untreated controls (Figures 5B, ). LatB- treatment on the other hand, led to an increase in -actin bundling, which was likely due to aggregation of -actin fragments in some of the root cells analyzed. Although occupancy and bundling were not affected by eBL, we found that eccentricity of -actin in LatB- and eBL-treated roots were reduced relative to controls (Figure 5D). It is tempting to speculate that eBL-induced reduction in -actin alignment alone is suf cient to account for  large part of the root autotropic inhibition observed here. It is important to note, however, that all of the -actin analyses reported here were conducted pre-clinorotation. It is possible that changes in -actin organization during the process of clinorotation were unaccounted for in our analyses. Experiments involving chemically  xing roots at various time points during clinorotation or  system in which live roots expressing the - actin reporters can be imaged on  clinostat, will be necessary to address such possibilities. Okamoto et al. (2015) proposed that the long -actin cables in the in orescence stem  ber cells were the structures that modulated organ straightening possibly by regulating cytoplasmic streaming. It is possible that eBL regulation of root autotropic straightening is facilitated by  population of -actin in speci  root cell types that are not detected by the quantitative metrics used in our studies. This could explain why eBL had only modest effects on overall -actin organization, but still caused LatB-like autotropic straightening defects. Another possibility is that dampening of global -actin dynamics by eBL as revealed by live cell imaging of etiolated  truncatula hypocotyls could account for autotropic straightening defects. Suppressed global -actin dynamics after eBL exposure could FIGURE  | Epi-Brassinolide (eBL) inhibited global -actin dynamics in etiolated hypocotyl epidermal cells of . truncatula expressing UBQ10:Lifeact-mGFP.

Unfortunately, we were unable to obtain global - actin dynamic data on . truncatula root cells because of technical dif culties associated with keeping actively growing roots within the microscope  eld of view. As such,  direct link between root -actin dynamics and root autotropism is missing. For the future,  suitable clinostat assay using . truncatula shoots should help clarify if reduced global -actin dynamics can explain eBL effects on organ straightening. Furthermore, live  uorescent protein-based -actin marker lines in . mays could help strengthen the link between -actin organization and autotropic organ growth (Wu et al., 2013). For more than  decade, genetically-encoded -actin reporters based on  uorescent protein technology have advanced our understanding of actin function during plant development (Voigt et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2008). In addition to new insights into the processes underlying directional root growth control, our work introduces  set of . truncatula lines expressing two types of genetically encoded -actin reporters. These new -actin reporter lines could potentially be used to address  range of biological questions. Speci cally,  future gravitational biology-related study in which these new . truncatula lines would be of value is the dynamic monitoring of -actin in various tissues of graviresponding roots using vertical stage microscopy (Von Wangenheim et al., 2017). Vertical stage microscopy combined with new imaging modalities such as airy scan should enable super-resolution of -actin during plant gravity response (Komis et al., 2018). Moreover, some light sheet microscopy platforms allow for plant organs to be positioned vertically. Such methods pave the way for long term and volumetric imaging of -actin dynamics during plant gravity response using these new . truncatula lines (Ove ka et al., 2018). Similar to previous reports in . thaliana plants expressing live cell -actin reporters (Ketelaar et al., 2004; Dyachok et al., 2014), mature . truncatula plants expressing Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP appear to have growth defects based on their reduced shoot and root dry weights when compared to controls. However, the negative growth effects induced by expressing these reporters were mild and not very pronounced in young seedlings. Thus, if used with caution, these Lifeact-mGFP and GFP-ABD2-GFP . truncatula lines should be  valuable addition to existing  uorescent protein-based toolkit for studying dynamic cellular processes in legumes (Ivanov and Harrison, 2014; Cvrckova and Oulehlova, 2017; Zhang et al., 2019). In conclusion, our results implicate brassinosteroids in root autotropism. Brassinosteroids modulate this process by modifying -actin organization and dynamics in  manner different from that of the actin-disrupting compound LatB. Regardless of the mechanisms by which eBL modi es -actin, our studies reinforce previous observations that the acto-myosin system is an important component of plant tropistic responses. Finally, through our work, we introduced  set of . truncatula lines expressing  uorescent protein-based reporters that could enable new studies of actin-mediated processes in legumes.

An elevation in [Ca2+]cyt levels is one of the earliest responses in plant cells after exposure to  range of environmental stimuli. Advances in understanding the role of [Ca2+]cyt in plant development has been facilitated by the use of genetically-encoded reporters such as GCaMP. Most of these studies have relied on promoters such as Cauli ower Mosaic Virus (35S) and Ubiquitin10 (UBQ10) to drive expression of GCaMP in all cell/tissue types. Plant organs such as roots consist of various cell types that likely exhibit unique [Ca2+]cyt responses to exogenous and endogenous signals. However, few studies have addressed this question. Here, we introduce  set of Arabidopsis thaliana lines expressing GCaMP3 in  ve root cell types including the columella, endodermis, cortex, epidermis, and trichoblasts. We found similarities and di erences in the [Ca2+]cyt signature among these root cell types when exposed to adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP), glutamate, aluminum, and salt, which are known to trigger [Ca2+]cyt increases in root cells. These cell type-targeted GCaMP3 lines provide  new resource that should enable more in depth studies that address how  particular environmental stimulus is linked to speci  root developmental pathways via [Ca2+]cyt. Keywords: GCaMP3; Arabidopsis; cell type speci city; calcium response; [Ca2+]cyt . Introduction Calcium (Ca2+) plays  vital role as  second messenger system in plant development and stress response. Because Ca2+ acts as  stress signal, it is one of the first responses plants have to environmental stimuli. This fast response is achieved through an influx of extracellular Ca2+ and an efflux of stored Ca2+ from the vacuole, endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and mitochondria that is achieved via  concentration gradient between the intracellular Ca2+ stores and the cytoplasm []. In non-stimulated conditions, the concentration of Ca2+ in the cytoplasm rests around 100 nM [ ]. This low concentration is maintained through +/Ca2+ antiporters and Ca2+-ATPases that move Ca2+ into the apoplast or into intracellular stores [,]. Once the response in the cell is initiated, the cell will return to homeostasis by storing excess Ca2+ back in the vacuole, ER, or mitochondria through active transport [], or by pumping it out into extracellular space through gated-ion channels in the plasma membrane. Once Ca2+ enters the cytoplasm in high concentrations, it binds with Ca2+-binding proteins to initiate  second messenger cascade [,]. Part of this signaling cascade is the activation of Ca2+-dependent protein kinases and the regulation of transcription factors to increase tolerance to the stress that caused the initial Ca2+ response. Much of our understanding about Ca2+ as  second messenger has come from the development of technologies that enable monitoring of free cytosolic Ca2+ ([Ca2+]cyt) changes in living cells. Early on, these technologies consisted of indicator dyes that had to be chemically or physically loaded into the cell, such as Calcium Green or Indo-. When Ca2+ levels in the cell became elevated upon exposing the cell to  speci  stimulus, these indicator dyes Int. . Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 6385; doi:10.3390/ijms21176385 www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 6385  of 15 increased  uorescence []. However, use of these indicator dyes in plant cells were often met with technical challenges including uneven dye loading, loss of cell viability after dye loading, and cells failing to take up the dyes [,]. Problems with these early indicator dyes were mitigated with the discovery of  suite of  uorescent proteins from jelly sh and other marine organisms [,]. Using molecular cloning techniques, selected regions of Ca2+-binding proteins could be fused with these  uorescent proteins to generate genetically-encoded Ca2+ sensors that change conformation upon Ca2+ binding []. Ca2+ binding induced changes in the conformation of  uorescent protein-based sensors result in enhanced  uorescence emission. One example of  genetically-encoded Ca2+ sensor is GCaMP. GCaMP consists of an enhanced green  uorescent protein (eGFP) fused to calmodulin (CaM) and myosin light-chain kinase (M13) [,10]. GCaMP3 is  modi ed form of GCaMP that features  circularly permutated enhanced GFP (eGFP)  anked by CaM and M13 that gives low  uorescence in the absence of Ca2+, which increases upon reversible binding of Ca2+ to the CaM domain [11]. To date, expression of CGaMP and other genetically-encoded Ca2+ sensors in plants are driven by constitutive promoters such as Cauli ower Mosaic Virus 35S (35S) and Ubiquitin 10 (UBQ10) [12,13]. Although plant lines constitutively expressing genetically-encoded Ca2+ sensors enabled the functional study of [Ca2+]cyt changes across entire plant organs [,13,14], it is likely that each cell type within the organ is characterized by  unique [Ca2+]cyt signature. While [Ca2+]cyt changes typically observed in the entire plant organ likely originate from more than one cell type, we lack tools to monitor these changes within speci  tissues or cells [15]. To address this need, we generated  set of lines in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, expressing GCaMP3 targeted to the columella, endodermis, epidermis, cortex, and trichoblast using cell-type speci  promoters [16]. We demonstrate the utility of these new GCaMP3 lines in reporting cell-type [Ca2+]cyt changes in roots treated with chemicals previously shown to induce [Ca2+]cyt increases in plants. . Results .. Expression of GCaMP3 in Di erent Root Cell Types of . thaliana To the best of our knowledge, plant lines expressing genetically encoded [Ca2+]cyt sensors that are available to the scienti  community are driven by constitutive promoters. . thaliana lines expressing the UBQ10:GCaMP3 construct, which we generated and used previously to study [Ca2+]cyt oscillations in root hairs [17], is one example. In addition to root hairs, GCaMP3  uorescence was detected in all cell-types of the primary root of . thaliana expressing the UBQ10:GCaMP3 construct (Figure ). Using confocal microscopy, strong  uorescence was observed in cells located at the root surface, such as the peripheral root cap and epidermis (Figure 1A,,). Moderate levels of  uorescence could also be detected in the underlying cortex (Figure 1C). However, in cells located deeper within the root, such as the columella and endodermis,  uorescence was obscured by the  uorescence from surface cells (Figure 1A,). This prompted us to generate  set of constructs that drive GCaMP3 expression in speci  root cell types. For this purpose, we used promoters described in the SWELL promoter collection including ATHB8 (columella), SCARECROW (SCR, endodermis), Pin-Formed  (PIN2, epidermis and cortex), PEP (cortex), and Proline rich protein (PRP3, trichoblasts) [16]. For the  ve constructs, we found that GCaMP3 signal was most prominent in the expected cell types (Figure ). For example, ATHB8 and SCR promoters drove strong GCaMP3 expression in the columella and endodermis, respectively (Figure 2A,). For ATHB8:GCaMP3-expressing lines, we also observed weak  uorescence in the peripheral cap cells and the stele. For SCR:GCaMP3,  uorescence in the endodermis was observed in all root developmental zones from the meristem and elongation zone, continuing into the maturation zone. Roots of PEP:GCaMP3- and PRP3:GCaMP3-expressing seedlings also showed  uorescence in the expected cell types (.., cortex and trichoblast, respectively) (Figure 2C,). On the other hand,\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 6385  of 15  uorescence was detected in the epidermis and cortex of PIN2:GCaMP3-expressing lines, consistent with observations of Marques-Bueno et al. (2016) [16] (Figure 2E). Figure .

Scale bar: 50  . .. Chemical Treatments of Cell-Type Speci  GCaMP3 Constructs Studies on Ca2+ signaling in plants over several years have revealed various stimuli that can trigger  rapid elevation in [Ca2+]cyt including cold, touch, wounding, hormones, reactive oxygen\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 6385  of 15 species, cyclic nucleotides, amino acids and nutrient/ionic stress [,18 23]. We used some of these known [Ca2+]cyt triggers to test the responsiveness of our root cell-speci  GCaMP3 lines. We  rst analyzed the response of the GCaMP3 lines to adenosine tri-phosphate (ATP) (Figure ). In mammalian systems, ATP is  neurotransmitter that is perceived by plasma membrane bound purinergic receptors, and its signaling role is facilitated through increases in [Ca2+]cyt [24]. While plants do not have the canonical purinergic receptors found in mammals, they perceive ATP via lectin receptor-like kinases and, similar to mammals, ATP elicits  rapid increase in [Ca2+]cyt [25 27]. Comparable to previous reports, application of ATP to the elongation zone of roots expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3 elicited  rapid rise in [Ca2+]cyt-dependent  uorescence followed by  gradual decline (Figure 3A) [,25]. To determine if the increase in [Ca2+]cyt was due exclusively to ATP, we applied the solvent control solution, which consisted of . Murashige Skoog (MS) solution without ATP to roots. We found that applying MS solution triggered  rise in [Ca2+]cyt that was delayed and lower in amplitude compared to the [Ca2+]cyt change caused by ATP (Figure 3A). This observation suggests that under our growing conditions, adding  drop of solvent control solution to the root can induce an increase in [Ca2+]cyt, which could be the result of  touch or hypoosmotic response [19,20,27,28]. Therefore, in testing the cell-type GCaMP3 lines, we included solvent control applications in all of the experiments so we could tease apart [Ca2+]cyt changes due to the desired stimulus from those resulting from  touch or hypoosmotic response.

Upon applying ATP to roots expressing cell-speci  GCaMP3 lines, we found similarities and di erences in the resulting [Ca2+]cyt signatures. For example, the PIN2:GCaMP3 lines, which expressed GCaMP3 in the epidermis and cortex (Figure ), displayed similar [Ca2+]cyt signatures as UBQ10:GCaMP3-expressing lines in response to ATP and the solvent control solution (Figure 3A,). This is not surprising given that GCaMP3 is strongly expressed in both the epidermis and cortex under the control of the UBQ10 and PIN2 promoters (Figures  and ). For lines expressing GCaMP3 in the trichoblasts, application of both ATP and MS control solution triggered  small increase in [Ca2+]cyt that had similar patterns (Figure 3C).",

This is not surprising given that GCaMP3 is strongly expressed in both the epidermis and cortex under the control of the UBQ10 and PIN2 promoters (Figures  and ). For lines expressing GCaMP3 in the trichoblasts, application of both ATP and MS control solution triggered  small increase in [Ca2+]cyt that had similar patterns (Figure 3C). For lines expressing GCaMP3 in cells located in the root interior such as the cortex, endodermis, and columella (supplementary video ), ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 6385  of 15 resembled the patterns of UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3-expressing lines. However, the [Ca2+]cyt increases triggered by application of MS control solution were not as prominent in these lines when compared to those lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in the epidermis (Figure 3D ). The next chemical we used to test the cell-speci  GCaMP3 lines was glutamic acid (Figure ). Like ATP, glutamic acid (glutamate) is  neurotransmitter in mammalian cells that can trigger  [Ca2+]cyt increase [,14]. Application of glutamate to the elongation zone of roots expressing the UBQ10:GCaMP3 construct induced  strong initial [Ca2+]cyt increase with  quick return to equilibrium (Figure 4A). The [Ca2+]cyt spikes induced by application of MS controls were also observed in this dataset. Compared to glutamate, the onset of [Ca2+]cyt increase was delayed in roots treated with MS solution. In this case, however, the [Ca2+]cyt spikes triggered by glutamate and the MS control solution were similar in amplitude (Figure 4A). Like the ATP treatment, [Ca2+]cyt response of roots expressing PIN2:GCaMP3 to glutamate was similar to roots expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3. Furthermore, [Ca2+]cyt changes in the root elongation zone of PIN2:GCaMP3-expressing seedlings in response to the MS control solution was delayed, but exhibited  lower amplitude (Figure 4B). Lines expressing PRP3:GCaMP3 also had  strong initial [Ca2+]cyt peak after glutamate treatment with  rapid return to equilibrium that resembled UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. Like UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines, application of MS control solution elicited  [Ca2+]cyt response that was delayed when compared to glutamate exposure (Figure 4C). By contrast, PEP:GCaMP3-expressing lines showed  dampened response to glutamate compared to lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in the root surface (Figure 4D). Close examination of the time course of [Ca2+]cyt signals in the cortex after glutamate application revealed  triphasic response, with two larger peaks and  delayed smaller peak. Surprisingly, the amplitude of glutamate-triggered [Ca2+]cyt increases in the cortex was less than that of MS treated roots (Figure 4D). The lines expressing SCR:GCaMP3 and ATHB8:GCaMP3 showed monophasic responses to glutamate with  gradual return to equilibrium, similar to lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in root surface cells. Furthermore, unlike lines with GCaMP expressed in the cortex and root surface cells, the MS control solution response for endodermis- and columella- targeted GCaMP3 had delayed responses and lower amplitudes (Figure 4E,).

Sci. 2020, 21, 6385  of 15 The third chemical we tested against the cell-type speci  GCaMP3 lines was Al3+ in the form of aluminum chloride (Figure ). Al3+ is  toxic tri-valent cation that competes with both Mg2+ and Ca2+ to increase the activity of Ca2+-ATPases while disrupting transport of Ca2+ through the plasma membrane [,29]. Similar to previous treatments, the root elongation zone of seedlings expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3 showed  monophasic [Ca2+]cyt response to Al3+ (Figure 5A). The onset of the [Ca2+]cyt increase after Al3+ treatment was delayed and lower in amplitude compared to ATP, glutamate and solvent control application (Figure 3A, Figure 4A and Figure 5A) []. In roots expressing PIN2:GCaMP3, Al3+ application elicited  biphasic [Ca2+]cyt response that consisted of an initial small peak that was quickly followed by  second larger peak, which was broader than the  rst peak. The onset of the [Ca2+]cyt response in PIN2:GCaMP3-expressing roots after Al3+ treatment occurred earlier than the [Ca2+]cyt response triggered by solvent controls (Figure 5B). In roots expressing PRP3:GCaMP3, Al3+-induced [Ca2+]cyt increase was larger in amplitude and had  broader peak compared to those observed in UBQ10:GCaMP3- and PIN2:GCaMP3-expressing roots (Figure 5C). The [Ca2+]cyt increases in roots expressing GCaMP3 in interior root tissues were less than roots expressing GCaMP3 in the surface tissues. Among the three lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in the interior cell types, the columella-speci  GCaMP3 line did not show an Al3+-induced [Ca2+]cyt peak (Figure 5F). The PEP:GCaMP3-expressing lines showed  biphasic [Ca2+]cyt response with  distinct  rst peak followed by  second peak with lower amplitude. Although the amplitude of the [Ca2+]cyt peak induced by application of MS solution was similar to the amplitude of the  rst Al3+-triggered [Ca2+]cyt peak, the onset of the latter was delayed (Figure 5D). SCR:GCaMP3-expressing roots exhibited an Al3+-induced [Ca2+]cyt response characterized by  broad peak and with  lower amplitude than peaks observed in the root surface- and cortex GCaMP3-expressing lines (Figure 5E).

Na+ is used to regulate the voltage equilibrium in cells, but also has direct  ects on the  ux of + into the cytosol [30]. Ca2+ is  regulator for the +  ux channels [30], so disruption of + into the cytosol may cause variation in the resting concentration of Ca2+. In roots expressing the  uorescent-based\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 6385  of 15 [Ca2+]cyt sensor Yellow Cameleon .60 (YC3.60), NaCl treatment resulted in cell-speci  [Ca2+]cyt transients in the early elongation zone [31]. Consistent with the results of Feng et al. (2018) [31], roots expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3 exhibited late-onset [Ca2+]cyt transients (.., >10 min) in cells of the elongation zone (Figure 6A; supplementary video ). These NaCl-triggered [Ca2+]cyt transients were observed in the cell-targeted GCaMP3 lines except for the endodermis-localized GCaMP3 line (Figure 6A ). In certain lines, the onset of [Ca2+]cyt transients occurred much earlier after NaCl application when compared to UBQ10:GCaMP3-expressing lines. The onset of NaCl-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients was fastest in roots of PRP3:GCaMP3-expressing lines followed by PEP:GCaMP3-expressing lines. The [Ca2+]cyt transients in the columella were only observed several minutes after NaCl application (.., 12 min after NaCl application; Figure 6C). Figure .

Modi cation of Growth Conditions and Chemical Application Methods to Mitigate Solvent Control-Induced [Ca2+]cyt Transients As shown in the preceding sections, the .5X MS control solution induced [Ca2+]cyt changes in UBQ10:GCaMP3 and lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in cells on the root surface and cortex (Figures  ). Although the MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt responses were clearly distinct from ATP, glutamate, and Al3+ treatments, we were concerned that the growth conditions in which these  rst experiments\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 6385  of 15 were conducted made roots more sensitive to osmotic changes and/or mechanical perturbation due to the process of adding the solutions. We argued that MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients could be dampened relative to the chemical applications by: () using freshly prepared MS plates for planting seeds and () pretreating roots two times with MS solution prior to application of the actual chemical solution. These modi cations in our treatment protocols were tested using ATP which typically generated peaks with the highest amplitude. Compared to the datasets shown in Figures  , the [Ca2+]cyt transients triggered by the MS solution were signi cantly dampened when fresh plates were used for the experiments (Figure ). The dampened MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients were observed in the two sequential MS applications. Pretreatment with MS solution had the added bene  of allowing roots to adapt prior to ATP application (adapted ATP = ATP:MS). Under these modi ed growth and pretreatment conditions, the ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases were lower in amplitude when compared to the [Ca2+]cyt increases shown in Figure . Despite the lower ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients, these [Ca2+]cyt responses were better separated from the [Ca2+]cyt responses induced by MS solution, particularly in lines expressing UBQ10:GCaMP3 and those in which GCaMP3 was expressed in root surface cell types and the cortex (Figure ). In addition to the dampened response, [Ca2+]cyt response to ATP:MS for UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines had broader peaks than those shown in Figure . For PRP3:GCaMP3-expressing lines, the [Ca2+]cyt response was markedly di erent from the initial ATP treatment (Figures 3C and 7C). Application of ATP after .5X MS adaptation caused  strong, monophasic response earlier than either UBQ10:GCaMP3 or PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. Lines expressing PEP:GCaMP3 showed  continued elevated [Ca2+]cyt response that oscillated throughout the 10 min time course compared to either UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines or the previous ATP treatment (Figures 3D and 7D). For lines expressing SCR:GCaMP3 or ATHB8:GCaMP3, the response was similar to previous ATP treatments, but without the strong transient peak (Figures 3E, and 7E,). After the cell-type speci  lines were adapted to the . MS control solution, the response time for ATP:MS was initiated later than the previous ATP treatment (Table ). Figure .

For lines expressing SCR:GCaMP3 or ATHB8:GCaMP3, the response was similar to previous ATP treatments, but without the strong transient peak (Figures 3E, and 7E,). After the cell-type speci  lines were adapted to the . MS control solution, the response time for ATP:MS was initiated later than the previous ATP treatment (Table ). Figure .

Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 6385  of 15 To further tease out the di erences among GCaMP3-expressing lines, we obtained the time elapsed from chemical application to maximum GCaMP3  uorescence (referred to as reaction time), and analyzed the relationship between chemicals using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with Tukey Post-Hoc test (Table ). Our analysis showed that reaction time was delayed in lines where GCaMP3 was expressed in inner cell types. When comparing the di erent chemical treatments, ATP, glutamate, and Al3+ showed similar responses (except ATHB8:GCaMP3 to Al3+) while adapted ATP:MS showed signi cantly slower reaction times to both ATP and glutamate (Table ). However, with such  small sample size, statistical signi cance may indicate  trend rather than actual signi cance.

Evaluation of [Ca2+]cyt Signatures from Similar Root Development Regions and Cell Types In comparing UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines with the other cell-type speci  GCaMP3 lines,  ROI was selected and the average of normalized  uorescence intensity was plotted. For the most part, the ROI in UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines was from the root epidermis and the average normalized  uorescence intensity from this ROI was compared with that of individual or groups of cells from the cell-type speci  GCaMP3 lines. This process did not enable direct comparisons of [Ca2+]cyt signatures between the same cell types or root developmental regions. To address this issue, we conducted another set of imaging experiments using ATP-treated UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. For these experiments,  more direct comparison was conducted by drawing ROIs in epidermal cells from similar positions along the root longitudinal axis encompassing the meristem, distal elongation zone, and central elongation zone (Figure 8A). In doing so, we found similarities and di erences in [Ca2+]cyt signatures between UBQ10:GCaMP3 and PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. For example, the ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt signatures of UBQ10:GCaMP3 in all root developmental regions were identical to those in the distal and central elongation zone of PIN2:GCaMP3 lines. In PIN2:GCaMP3 lines, however, the ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt signature had  much greater amplitude in the meristem (Figure 8A,). We extended our analysis by drawing ROIs in presumptive columella or endodermis of UBQ10:GCaMP3 and comparing the resulting [Ca2+]cyt signatures from these ROIs with those of ATHB8:GCaMP3 and SCR:GCaMP3. For the columella, we found that ATHB8:GCaMP3 lines displayed an ATP-triggered [Ca2+]cyt signature with  sustained peak throughout the 10 min time course. On the other hand, the ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt signature from the presumptive columella region of UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines was transient (Figure 8C). For the endodermis, the peak of ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt increase was higher in UBQ10:GCaMP3 when compared to SCR:GCaMP3 (Figure 8D). Int. . Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 6385 10 of 15 Figure .

Fluorescence values were normalized to the lowest  uorescence value. . Discussion In this paper, we introduced  set of . thaliana lines expressing the intensiometric [Ca2+]cyt reporter GCaMP3 targeted to speci  root cell types. Roots of these cell type speci  GCaMP3 lines responded to chemical treatments such as ATP, glutamate, Al3+, and NaCl by exhibiting increases in [Ca2+]cyt-dependent CGaMP3  uorescence. Imaging [Ca2+]cyt changes in cell types in response to some of these chemicals using lines in which genetically-encoded [Ca2+]cyt reporters are expressed ubiquitously have been attempted previously. This was done by drawing  region of interest corresponding to  particular tissue/cell type. For example, it was shown that Al3+-induced biphasic [Ca2+]cyt signatures in the root elongation zone occurred predominantly in the cortex when compared with the epidermis []. While this has proven  ective for marking developmental regions along the longitudinal axis of the root [,27], specifying  region of interest to designate root tissue/cell types along the radial axis for  uorescence-based measurements of [Ca2+]cyt can be problematic because this does not guarantee complete separation of signals from adjacent cell types. This problem becomes even more challenging for cell types located in the innermost regions of the root such as the columella and endodermis. Moreover, the ability to consistently draw  region of interest to outline the root cortex requires that the root grew in  particular orientation during the imaging experiments []. Here, we documented some of the advantages of the cell type speci  GCaMP3 lines by comparing [Ca2+]cyt signatures from ROIs marking presumptive columella and endodermis in UBQ10:GCaMP3\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 6385 11 of 15 lines with those of ATHB8:GCaMP3 and SCR:GCaMP3. This analysis revealed stark di erences in both the amplitude and shape of [Ca2+]cyt signatures. Di erences were also uncovered when equivalent root developmental regions were compared, particularly with regard to the amplitude of [Ca2+]cyt signatures in the meristem (Figure ). The di erences are likely due to contaminating signals from other cell types in UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines. The use of cell type speci  GCaMP3 lines described here could potentially mitigate such problems. The [Ca2+]cyt transients in the cell type speci  lines induced by these various chemicals had various patterns when compared with lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed ubiquitously. similarity in patterns occurred within the root surface cells  responses to the di erent chemical treatments and again within the root inner cell types. Lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in innermost root cell types such as the columella and endodermis generally had slower response times when compared to lines with GCaMP3 expressed in root surface cells. The delayed response times in lines with GCaMP3 expressed in the columella and endodermis was observed in all chemical treatments (Table ; Figure ). One could argue that because of the innermost location of the columella and endodermis, the delay in the response times might be due to the longer time it takes for the chemical to make contact with the target cells. The fact that columella and endodermis exhibit minimal or no [Ca2+]cyt increase after application of .5X MS supports this possibility. An alternative hypothesis is that the delayed [Ca2+]cyt response in the innermost cell types is due to an inward moving [Ca2+]cyt wave, which is not easily revealed when GCaMP3 is expressed ubiquitously or on the root surface. From our data, these inward-directed [Ca2+]cyt waves appear to be most prominent in ATP- and glutamate-treated roots (Figures ,  and ). The GCaMP3 lines described here could present  signi cant tool for better understanding the radial direction of [Ca2+]cyt waves in roots. meaningful set of experiments with GCaMP3 lines expressed in innermost cell types will be to locally apply  small volume of the chemical stimulus to the root epidermis. The line that was most similar to UBQ10:GCaMP3 with regard to chemical-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients was PIN2:GCaMP3. This was not surprising given that the PIN2 promoter drives GCaMP3 expression in root epidermal cells, which is the cell type that is readily imaged in UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines due to its location on the root surface. With the PEP:GCaMP3 lines described here, we were able observe biphasic, triphasic and oscillatory [Ca2+]cyt signatures after Al3+ treatment that were reminiscent of some of the observations made by Rincon-Zachary et al. (2010) [] (Figure ). The cortex- and trichoblast-targeted GCaMP3 lines also revealed an earlier onset of NaCl-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients when compared to UBQ10:GCaMP3 lines (Figure ). It has been shown that [Ca2+]cyt transients in roots exposed to NaCl is part of the cellular machinery that prevents root cells from rupturing under salinity stress. The plasma membrane-localized receptor-like kinase, Feronia (FER), is required for root growth recovery after encountering high salinity conditions [31]. Because fer mutants displayed  high incidence of cortical cell rupture when compared to wild type after exposure to NaCl, it is tempting to speculate that earlier onset of [Ca2+]cyt transients in the cortex revealed by the PEP:GCaMP3-expressing lines could be  mechanism to maintain root growth integrity. The cell type GCaMP3 lines described here should be useful in testing this hypothesis. While testing the various cell type speci  GCaMP3 lines, we encountered  number of technical challenges brought about by our seedling growth conditions. In several experiments, we found that applying the .5X MS control solution alone could trigger  rise in [Ca2+]cyt. The MS only-induced [Ca2+]cyt transients were most prominent in the UBQ10:GCaMP3-expressing lines and those in which GCaMP3 was expressed in root surface cell types (.., PIN2:GCaMP3 and PRP3:GCaMP3). The [Ca2+]cyt transients observed after MS treatment were reminiscent of touch-induced [Ca2+]cyt responses [20], and recent studies on ATP-induced [Ca2+]cyt signaling [27], suggesting that we might have been eliciting  touch response as the various solutions were added to the root.",

In support of this hypothesis, our method for root [Ca2+]cyt imaging involved planting seed of the reporter lines on  thin layer of agarose to secure the root while at the same time allowing for the root cells to be accessible to the various chemical treatments ([]; see Methods). It is possible that some of the [Ca2+]cyt transients\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 6385 12 of 15 observed in response to MS application resulted from roots that were not securely anchored to the agarose medium. Alternatively, the prevalence of MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases in some of our experiments could be due to osmotic changes when the solution was applied. Because agar for imaging roots was poured in advance, it was possible that liquid in some of the plates may have evaporated during storage. This could have led to some plates having an MS solution that was more concentrated than the treatment solution. To test the possibility that MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt changes were due to touch or hypoosmotic shock, we repeated the ATP application experiments using roots that emerged from seeds planted on plates with freshly prepared MS-supplemented agarose. Furthermore, roots were pretreated with MS solution prior to ATP treatment. Under these modi ed growth and treatment conditions, we found that MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases were signi cantly dampened (Figures  and ). Given that [Ca2+]cyt changes are responses that can be elicited by  wide range of stimuli, the results described here highlight the need to carefully consider the growth and treatment conditions, and to include appropriate controls when conducting [Ca2+]cyt imaging experiments. Based on these observations, it is imperative that fresh plates be prepared prior to planting the reporter lines and that roots be pretreated with the solvent control solution for  few hours to allow seedlings to adapt. Some studies have shown [Ca2+]cyt signals propagate along the longitudinal axis of roots [,26]. Meanwhile, another study has indicated that [Ca2+]cyt signal propagation from the apical into the sub-apical can also occur [27]. The cell type speci  GCaMP3 lines described here, particularly those lines in which GCaMP3 is expressed in inner root cells such as the cortex-, endodermis- and columella-speci  lines could shed new insights into the direction of [Ca2+]cyt signal propagation within the roots. The MS-induced [Ca2+]cyt responses in lines in which GCaMP3 was expressed in the endodermis and columella were not observed. However, these cell types exhibited [Ca2+]cyt increases in response to some of the chemicals, indicating that these [Ca2+]cyt changes can be attributed to the chemical itself. In this regard, it is noteworthy that columella-targeted GCaMP3 lines did not exhibit  [Ca2+]cyt increase after Al3+ treatment while those lines with GCaMP3 expressed in the endodermis lacked  [Ca2+]cyt response to NaCl. With the establishment of response patterns from the cell type speci  GCaMP3 lines when exposed to various chemical treatments, investigation into unique aspects of di erent root tissues/cells, such as signal propagation direction and response intensity, can be more readily explored. . Materials and Methods .. Generation of Cell-Type Speci  Promoter GCaMP Lines Each promoter was ampli ed from genomic DNA extracted from wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings using the Plant DNAzol Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) (Table S1). The sequence preceding the start codon for each gene was used in each instance. The resulting fragments were digested with PstI and SalI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA;  and cloned into  modi ed pCAMBIA1390 vector [32]. GCaMP3 was ampli ed from plasmid DNA and digested with XmaI and BstEII (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA;  and then cloned behind each promoter construct in pCAMBIA1390. To generate UBQ10:GCaMP3,  similar approach was taken. GCaMP3 was again ampli ed from plasmid DNA and then digested with EcoRI and SpeI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA;  and cloned behind the Ubiquitin 10 promoter in  previously described pCAMIA1390 vector [33]. Plasmid containing GCaMP3 was  gift from Loren Looger (Addgene plasmid # 22692;  RRID:Addgene_22692; [34]). Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation using the  oral dip method was used to generate Arabidopsis ecotype Col- plants expressing the GCaMP3 constructs [35]. All primers used in this study are listed in Table S2. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 6385 13 of 15 .. Preparation of . thaliana Seedlings for Imaging Seeds of the various . thaliana GCaMP3 lines were planted on coverslips coated with  thin layer of MS-supplemented low-melting agarose. This set-up was prepared by pouring  mL of autoclaved .% low-melting agarose in .5X MS solution (pH .) on 48   60 mm No. coverslips (Thermo Scienti , gold seal cover glass reorder no. 3334, Waltham, MA, USA; www.thermoscienti .com) as described in Rincon-Zachary et al. (2010) []. Coverslips with polymerized agarose were placed in  cm diameter round Petri dishes and stored at    prior to planting seeds. In another set of experiments, seeds were planted as soon as the agarose polymerized. Petri dishes and coverslips with the planted seeds were kept in    for  days and transferred to  Conviron growth chamber (Controlled Environments Ltd., Winnipeg, MB, Canada) set to 24   with 14 /10  day/night cycle. Petri dishes with the coverslips were kept vertical to enable the roots to grow down and straight along the surface of the agarose. Seedlings were imaged when primary roots were about   cm long, which was   days after transfer to the Conviron. .. Validation of GCaMP3 Expression in Root Cell Types Validation of GCaMP3 expression in the target root cell types was conducted with an inverted Leica TCS SP8- Confocal Laser Scanning Microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany;  Seedlings from the Conviron were secured in  horizontal orientation on the stage of the microscope. Seedling roots were illuminated with the 488 nm line of the Argon laser using  40  (numerical aperture .) water immersion objective and emitted light detected at 510 nm. For some lines, single optical images were acquired at  pixel resolution of 1024   1024. For other lines,  -series was acquired by capturing 81 images at . intervals and - images were generated using the LAS visualization software of the Leica confocal microscope. .. Chemical Treatments and Measurement of Ca2+-Dependent GCaMP3 Fluorescence Stock solutions of   ATP (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; A7699-1G), glutamate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; G1149-100G), aluminum chloride (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA; Cas. No. 7784-13-) and sodium chloride (.. Baker, Phillipsburg, NJ, USA; 3624-19) were made with deionized water and stored at    prior to use. Working solutions of  mM Al3+,  mM ATP,  mM Glu, and 150 mM NaCl were made by adding the appropriate volume of the stock solution in .5X MS at pH .. Working solutions were made fresh prior to the imaging experiments. To measure [Ca2+]cyt-dependent GCaMP3  uorescence, images of growing roots were acquired every   for 10 to 15 min using the Leica SP8- confocal microscope. Images were captured at  scanning speed of 600 MHz and pixel resolution of 512   300. Baseline GCaMP3  uorescence of the roots was  rst acquired for  min after placing seedlings on the stage of the microscope. Twenty   of the treatment solution was then added on top of the agarose medium where the root was growing using an adjustable volume pipette while imaging continued. From the collected images, the average  uorescence intensity was acquired by marking  rectangular region of interest corresponding to the speci  cell type using the rectangular selection tool of the SPX- LAS software. GCaMP3  uorescence () values were normalized using the formula  = ( F0) F0 where  is the  uorescence intensity at some time point and F0 is the lowest  uorescence intensity point for the data set. Normalized  uorescence values were reported as the mean   SE of at least three independent seedlings per GCaMP3 construct [36]. Another round of intensity video imaging was taken for the . MS control solution to generate the MS control  uorescence curves.

While all homologues tested thus far encode channel activity, many show functional differences. Here we tested . coli and  aureus chimeras and find that the periplasmic region of the protein, particularly . coli I49 and the equivalent  aureus F47 at the periplasmic lipid-aqueous interface of the first transmembrane domain, drastically influences both the open dwell time and threshold of channel opening. One mutant shows  severe hysteresis, confirming the importance of this residue in determining the energy barriers for channel gating. We propose that this site acts similar to  spring for  clasp knife, adjusting the resistance for obtaining and stabilizing an open or closed channel structure. Keywords mechanosensitive channel; channel kinetics; osmoregulation; protein-lipid interactions Introduction The ability to detect mechanical forces is at the basis of not only the senses of touch, hearing and balance but also cardiovascular and osmotic regulation. In essence, mechanosensation is probably the oldest sense and is fundamental for many life functions. The primary way that organisms detect forces is through mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels. The best-studied mechanosensitive channels are from bacteria, and because relatively little is known of mechanosensors from higher organisms, these channels are  model for how  protein can sense and respond to mechanical forces. 2013 Elsevier Inc.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript\n\nThe mechanosensitive channel of large conductance (MscL) is  bacterial channel located in the cytoplasmic membrane that is gated by membrane tension (Blount et al., 2008a; Blount et al., 2007; Blount et al., 2008b; Booth and Blount, 2012). Although observed in the vast majority of bacterial species, the channels from Escherichia coli (. coli) have been the best studied. The physiological role of MscL, and members of an unrelated bacterial mechanosensitive channel family, MscS ( for small conductance), is to serve as biological  emergency release valves  to protect cells from lysis upon an acute decrease in osmotic environment, commonly referred to as osmotic downshock; it accomplishes this by rapidly releasing cytoplasmic osmolytes (Booth and Blount, 2012; Levina et al., 1999). The MscL channel is less sensitive than MscS to membrane tension, but it generates  larger pore size, upwards of 30  (Cruickshank et al., 1997), suggesting it is the last-ditch effort for survival. The MscL family is highly conserved and has  simple structural organization (Balleza and Gomez-Lagunas, 2009; Pivetti et al., 2003). This exaggerated response and simple construction lends itself as  paradigm for how MS channels, in general, can sense and respond to membrane stretch. -ray crystallography has resolved  MscL homologue from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Tb-MscL) to be  homopentamer with each subunit containing an amphipathic -terminal cytoplasmic  -helix running along the cytoplasmic membrane, followed by the two transmembrane  -helices (TM1 and TM2) that are connected by  periplasmic loop, and ending with the five -terminal  -helixes forming  cytoplasmic helical bundle (Chang et al., 1998; Steinbacher et al., 2007) (also see Fig. 1A). more recent structure has also been resolved for the Staphylococcus aureus (. aureus) MscL orthologue (Sa-MscL), which shows  tetrameric rather than pentameric complex (Liu et al., 2009); however, this appears to be  detergent-induced oligomeric rearrangement since the channel forms almost exclusively pentamers in vivo (Dorwart et al., 2010; Iscla et al., 2011). Although the Sa- MscL structure is unlikely to be physiologically relevant, it is worth noting that many of the interactions between the transmembrane domains are similar to those observed in the Tb- MscL crystal structure, suggesting an overall structural conservation within this highly conserved family. Although highly homologous, MscL channels from different species can vary in threshold of activation, conductance and open dwell time (Folgering et al., 2005; Maurer et al., 2000; Moe et al., 1998). For example, Sa-MscL has  sequence identity of 47% and similarity of 69% with . coli MscL (Eco-MscL) (Fig. 1B); however, the major physiological differences between the activities of these channels is that the Sa-MscL has much shorter open dwell times (Moe et al., 1998) and requires greater membrane tension to open. To identify the structural features underlying these functional differences, we have generated chimeras in which we have exchanged protein domains, subdomains, and ultimately even individual amino acids, and determined the kinetics and threshold of activation of the resulting channels. Surprisingly, the data indicate that the periplasmic region of the protein, particularly one residue located at the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface, plays  major role in both the open dwell time and threshold of activation, or, for simplicity, what we will from here on refer to as mechanosensitivity of the channel. The finding that  site at the membrane interface plays such  crucial physiological role affirms the intimate interactions that membrane-tension-gated channels have with their lipid environment. Results The periplasmic region of the channel plays  major role in defining channel kinetics In an attempt to correlate channel kinetics with specific regions of the protein, numerous chimeras of the Eco- and Sa-MscL channel proteins were generated.

The nomenclature of all chimeras tested is as follows:  and  represent regions from Eco- and Sa-MscL protein, respectively, which is followed by numbers showing the locations according to the Eco-MscL registry. As shown in Figure , recording the single channel openings of many Eco- and Sa-MscL chimeras revealed  pattern in channel open dwell time. Figure 2A shows chimeras with very short open dwell times, similar to wild type Sa-MscL. Chimeras in this panel share  common sequence in what is essentially the TM1/ periplasmic loop lipid interface of the Sa-MscL, specifically amino acids (aa) 44-49. In contrast to chimeras shown in Figure 2A, channels shown in Figure 2B share  common sequence in the same region which, instead is from Eco-MscL. These chimeras also contain the periplasmic loop and beginning of TM2 from Eco-MscL, thus giving  total Eco-MscL domain of aa 44-77. This common sequence correlates with longer open dwell times, similar to the Eco-MscL activities. The analyses of additional chimeras demonstrated that different subdomains of this entire periplasmic region, aa 44-77, effect different behaviors in channel kinetics. The most dramatic example is seen in Figure 2C, where we found that if  channel contains the TM1 periplasmic region of Eco-MscL, aa 44-49, as well as the periplasmic loop region from Sa- MscL, aa 50-77,  super-long open dwell time channel is produced, thus suggesting that both regions lead to stabilization of the open state; note that the time scale of the two chimeras in this panel is 86-fold and 140-fold of that for chimeras shown in panels  and , respectively. This latter observation allows us to make some predictions. It first suggests that  combination of Sa-MscL  shortening  effects of Sa-MscL 44-49 and Eco-MscL aa 50-77 should yield  channel with  super-short  channel kinetics. While Figure 2A is consistent with this prediction, it cannot be rigorously tested; the equipment used cannot easily resolve channel openings below 1ms, which is approximately the longest opening for the Sa-MscL channel. However, it also predicts that  combination of the  shortening  effects of Sa-MscL aa 44-49 with the  lengthening  effects of Sa-MscL aa 50-77 in an Eco-MscL background would lead to  channel with intermediate kinetics, perhaps not dissimilar to Eco-MscL. Indeed, as seen in Figure 2D, this prediction is upheld. Since aa 50-77 contains both the non- conserved periplasmic loop (aa 50-74) as well as the highly conserved beginning of TM2 (aa 75-77), the different effect of aa 50-77 from Sa- and Eco-MscL is very likely generated by differences in the periplasmic loop (aa 50-74). The effects of the periplasmic loop are not easily attributed to  shorter sub-domain. Chimeras containing the end of TM1 (aa 44-49) from Eco-MscL and only the latter part of periplasmic loop region (aa 56-77) from Sa-MscL also show an increase in open dwell times, but not as dramatic as that observed in Figure 2C (in Fig. S1). Hence, the nonconserved periplasmic loop appears to act as  unit in its regulation of channel kinetics. While the region of the protein from aa 44-77 appears to play  vital role in defining the kinetics of the channel, any structure/function relationship of conductance and mechanosensitivity appears to be much more complicated. There is no obvious correlation between these periplasmic regions and channel conductance or mechanosensitivity. For example, using an accepted mechanosensitivity gage(Blount et al., 1999; Blount et al., 1996a; Ou et al., 1998) where MscS is used as an internal standard within the patch, and the ratio of gating threshold pressure for MscL (pL) divided by the threshold pressure of MscS (pS) is determined, we found the pL/pS ratio ranged from .85 to . with wild type Eco- MscL at .47 and Sa-MscL at .96, and the most sensitive chimera, SES56-77 (ratio .85), and one of the least sensitive, ESE44-77 (ratio .), are in the same group shown in Figure 2A. For these chimeras we could find no correlation between either conductance or mechanosensitivity with the channel open dwell times. Yang et al. Page  Cell Rep.

Hence, the combination of Eco-MscL aa 44-49 and Sa-MscL periplasmic loop leads to MscL channels with extremely long openings, as shown in Figure 2C. single residue at the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface has  pronounced effect on channel kinetics In contrast to the periplasmic loop, the periplasmic portion of TM1 is small and relatively conserved. Note that the SES44-49 chimera shown in Figure 2C, which has extremely long open dwell times, contains only  alternative residues relative to the wild type Sa-MscL channel (G46 is conserved). In order to determine if  specific site within the end of TM1 (aa 44-49) is responsible for controlling open dwell times, we generated site-directed mutations. As shown in Figure 3A, mutations of the Eco-MscL residues within this region were systematically changed back to the Sa-MscL sequence. Changing P44 back to , PL44-45 to LI, L47 to  and L48 to  had no apparent effect on the aberrantly long channel openings.",

Changing P44 back to , PL44-45 to LI, L47 to  and L48 to  had no apparent effect on the aberrantly long channel openings. In contrast, mutation of I49 to  drastically reduced the channel open dwell time. small, and as of yet unexplained change in conductance was noted: I49F was .48 .04 nS, while the other mutants ranged from .80 to .05 nS; however, all were much larger than the conductance of Sa-MscL (. . nS), again suggesting that this is not  site of major regulation of channel conductance. On the other hand, the data indicate that residue 49, located at the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface, is an important site for defining channel kinetics. If residue 49 indeed controls the open dwell time, then mutation of this residue within wild type Sa- and Eco-MscL backgrounds should also alter channel kinetics. We therefore exchanged the amino acids at this location. As shown in Figure 3B, mutation of Eco-MscL I49 to the residue of the comparable site of Sa-MscL, , generates  channel with short open dwell times, similar to the Sa-MscL. Conversely, mutation of the Sa-MscL equivalent site, F47, to the Eco-MscL  leads to  channel with pronounced long open dwell times. Consistent with our findings that the Sa-MscL periplasmic loop defines long open dwell times, isoleucine at this site in the wild type Sa-MscL background leads to much longer channel openings than observed for the wild type Eco-MscL activity. Therefore, the Eco- MscL I49, and the Sa-MscL equivalent site, F47, is important in controlling the open dwell time of wild type MscL channels as well as chimeras. In sum, these data demonstrate that  single amino acid at the periplasmic end of TM1 can have dramatic effects on the stabilization of the open state of the channel. Additional mutational analysis of the single residue at the TM1/periplasmic loop lipid interface shows  correlation of the properties of residue substitutions with channel kinetics and mechanosensitivity In an attempt to determine the possible mechanisms for the role of this site in controlling channel openings, we mutated F47 in Sa- MscL into different amino acids. As shown in Figure 4A, Figure S2 and Table S1, mutations at this site led to channels with varying open dwell times that correlate with the hydrophobicity of the substitutions (r2=.34, =.047). The hydrophobic amino acids  and  effected very long openings while those with charged side chains,  and , led to shorter openings. However, all three aromatic amino acids anomalously led to very short openings. Among all the mutants that effect long open dwell times, F47L had an obvious hysteresis. As shown in Figure 4B, the channel showed  delay of several seconds in both opening and closing upon pressure changes. Boltzmann functions of open probability (Po) versus Yang et al. Page  Cell Rep.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript\n\npressure were quite different for opening (P1/ = . of pL/pS) and closing (P1/ = . of pL/ pS) when the duration of each pressure step is from . to 4s. The difference of the P1/ for channel opening and closing was not apparent when slower pressure ramp (> 30s) was applied. Such hysteresis was also noted for the chimeras, SES44-49 and ESE50-77, discussed above, and appears to be an extreme exaggeration of  very mild hysteresis (less than  10% change between opening and closing P1/) of the wild type Eco-MscL reported previously (Kamaraju et al., 2010). All of the mutations at Sa-F47 caused  decrease in pL/pS ratio reflecting  more sensitive channel, as shown in Figure 4C and Figure S2. Moreover, the pL/pS ratio correlated with the hydrophobicity of the amino acid substitutions (r2=., =.027), with hydrophobic amino acids effecting higher pL/pS ratios, and thus reflecting  channel that is less sensitive to membrane tension. In contrast with the kinetic data discussed above, and as shown in Figure 4A, the three  bulky  aromatic amino acids followed this correlation with mechanosensitivity well (Fig. 4C), suggesting  different mechanism underlying how the hydrophobicity of residue 47 affects channel kinetics and mechanosensitivity; in essence, the outliers for the correlation shown in Figure 4A are not seen in 4C. Consistent with this hypothesis, no correlation between open dwell time and pL/pS ratio of all mutations at F47 was observed (Fig. 4D). In summary, the above data confirm that the residue at this location plays  profound role in defining Sa-MscL open dwell times as well as mechanosensation; while hydrophobicity and  bulk  may help to define the channel kinetics, hydrophobicity alone plays the major role in determining mechanosensitivity. To test whether the equivalent site, I49, in Eco-MscL also plays an important role in channel function, we selectively mutated I49 to , , and . Surprisingly, we found that same mutations changed channel kinetics and mechanosensitivity with  similar trend as that observed for Sa-MscL (Fig. 5A and  and Fig. S3). These data suggest that this site has  conserved function among orthologues. Discussion While several studies on Eco- or Tb-MscL have suggested that the periplasmic region may play  role in MscL channel regulation (Ajouz et al., 2000; Blount et al., 1996b; Jeon and Voth, 2008; Maurer et al., 2000; Maurer and Dougherty, 2003; Park et al., 2004; Tsai et al., 2005), no one had successfully identified  single sub-domain or residue that acted as  variable spring element, in either  consistent or opposing manner, across bacterial species. In this study, using  chimera approach we were able to identify such subdomains, and ultimately,  single residue. We initially found that the periplasmic loop of Eco-MscL confers short channel openings and that of Sa-MscL defines long openings. In contrast, the relatively conserved TM1/ periplasmic lipid interface (44 49) influenced channel kinetics in an opposite manner with that from Eco-MscL effecting long open dwell times, and that from Sa-MscL generating short open dwell times. Thus, these two periplasmic regions appear to work in concert within these two orthologues, and the engineered combination of the Eco-MscL TM1/ periplasmic lipid interface and the Sa-MscL periplasmic loop leads to MscL channels with  stabilized open state and extremely long open dwell times. The further dissection of the TM1/periplasmic loop interface led to the finding that  single residue at the lipid interface, I49 for Eco-MscL and the analogous site F47 for Sa-MscL, has profound effects on channel kinetics, thus suggesting an important role of protein-lipid interactions at this region. Furthermore, we generated one particular mutant by site directed mutagenesis, Sa-MscL F47L, which has an extreme channel phenotype in that it shows  Yang et al. Page  Cell Rep.

These data demonstrate that not only can the energy barrier for gating, or the transition between closed and open states, be modified by  mutation at Sa-F47, but that the transition from closed to open can be drastically different from that for going from open to closed states. recent molecular dynamic simulation study on Eco-MscL channel gating suggests that, during the gating process, membrane thinning induces  kink within the TM1/periplasmic loop interface, essentially in and around Eco-I49, which causes outward motion of the periplasmic loop away from the pore center (Deplazes et al., 2012). We propose that the easing or resisting of some restraint, such as this proposed kink formation, may modulate the transition between open and closed states, like adjusting the spring on  clasp knife. Studying additional channels altered by site-directed mutagenesis, we found consistent correlations between residue properties and their effects on channel function for Sa- as well as Eco-MscL; these data suggest  common functional role for this site between orthologues. As  general rule, hydrophobic residues led to longer open times, although streamlined hydrophobic residues appear to be more efficient in this aspect than those containing bulkier aromatic rings, presumably because of some sort of steric hindrance of the latter. The role of this residue in channel mechanosensation was also studied, and more hydrophobic substitutions were found to decrease mechanosensitivity. Therefore, increasing the hydrophobicity appears to increase the energy barrier required to achieve an open state, but once achieved, the open state is stabilized; increasing the hydrophilicity does the opposite, demonstrating that this spring element is adjusted by hydrophobicity. These findings are reminiscent of early studies suggesting that hydrophobic interactions, coined   hydrophobic lock , at the pore constriction keeps the channel closed; according to this theory, it is the exposure of these residues to the aqueous solution that is  major energy barrier for channel opening (Blount et al., 2007; Blount and Moe, 1999; Moe et al., 2000; Yoshimura et al., 1999). Note, however, that the  lock  is due to the bundling of hydrophobic residues from each of the subunits at the constriction of the pore, whereas here we found  residue at the lipid interface where no such bundling of residues is likely to occur. Although we found that the hydrophobicity of this spring element at the TM1 periplasmic lipid interface is important in both channel kinetics and mechanosensation, it is important to note that there are differences in the two correlations. For example, aromatic amino acids fit the hydropathy correlation for mechanosensation but not open dwell time. Several studies emphasize the importance of aromatics in potential lipid interactions for MscL (Sawada et al., 2012) as well as other mechanosensitive channels such as TRPY1 and other TRP channels (Su et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2007) and belts of aromatics are seen in other membrane proteins, including KcsA (Doyle et al., 1998). Thus, aromatic residue-lipid interactions may play more of  role in mechanosensation than kinetics. We also observed that there is no correlation between mechanosensitivity and open dwell time for the various substitutions. Hence, although the relative hydrophobicity of this spring element effects changes in both kinetics and mechanosensation, it does so by different underlying mechanisms. In summary, by initially using  chimera approach, we identified  single amino acid serves as   clasp knife spring  for the resistance and stability of channel opening and closing. The hydrophobicity and steric shape of this residue, complemented by the periplasmic loop, appears to define channel mechanosensitivity and kinetics in both Sa- and Eco-MscL. Yang et al.

Patch buffer contained 200 mM KCl, 90 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, and  mM HEPES (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), pH .. Data were acquired at  20 mV at  sampling rate of 20 kHz with  - kHz filter, using an AxoPatch 200B amplifier in conjunction with Axoscope software (Axon Instruments, Union City, CA, USA). For simplicity, the channel openings are shown upwards in the figures. piezoelectric pressure transducer (World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL, USA) was used to monitor the pressure introduced to patch membrane by suction throughout the experiments. Measurements were performed using Clampfit9 from pCLAMP9 (Axon Instruments). For the kinetic experiments, the data were fit to  three open state model, as previously performed (Blount et al., 1996a; Blount et al., 1996b; Ou et al., 1998). The two longer time constants (  and  ) could be easily determined; the shortest is beyond the resolution of the equipment used. All kinetic data were obtained from at least 300 opening events per mutant from three independent experiments performed in at least two independent spheroplast preparations. Mechanosensitivity was determined as previously described (Blount et al., 1999; Blount et al., 1996a; Ou et al., 1998). Briefly, MscS is used as an internal standard within the patch, and the ratio of gating pressure for MscL divided by the threshold pressure of MscS is determined; here we will refer to this as the pL/pS ratio. All mechanosensitivity data were obtained from at least three independent recordings performed in at least two independent spheroplast preparations.

It allows cells to become specialized and stably maintain those unique characteristics throughout the life of the organism, suppresses the deleterious expression of viral genes and other non-host DNA elements, and provides  mechanism for response to environmental stimuli. Aberrant DNA methylation (hyper- or hypomethylation) and its impact on gene expression have been implicated in many disease processes, including cancer1. To enable cost-effective DNA methylation analysis for  variety of applica- tions, Illumina offers  robust methylation profiling platform consisting of proven chemistries and the iScan and HiScan SQ systems. The Human- Methylation450 BeadChip (Figure ) offers  unique combination of comprehensive, expert-selected coverage and high throughput at  low price, making it ideal for screening large sample populations such as those used in genome-wide association study (GWAS) cohorts. By providing quantitative methylation measurement at the single-CpG site level for normal and formalin-fixed parafin-embedded (FFPE) samples, this assay offers powerful resolution for understanding epigenetic changes. Comprehensive Genome-Wide Coverage The Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip provides unparalleled, genome-wide coverage featuring comprehensive gene region and CpG island coverage, plus additional high-value content selected with the guidance of methylation experts. Infinium HD technology enables content selection independent of bias-associated limitations often associated with methylated DNA capture methods. As  result, 99% of RefSeq genes are covered, including those in regions of low CpG island density and at risk for being missed by commonly used capture methods. Importantly, coverage was targeted across gene regions with sites in the promoter region, 'UTR, first exon, gene body, and 'UTR in order to provide the broadest, most comprehensive view of methylation state possible (Figure ). This multiple-site approach was extended to CpG islands/CpG island regions for which 96% of islands were covered overall, with multiple sites within islands and island shores, as well as those regions flanking island shores (island shelves). Beyond gene and CpG island regions, multiple additional content categories requested by methylation experts were also included:   CpG sites outside of CpG islands   Non-CpG methylated sites identified in human stem cells   Differentially methylated sites identified in tumor versus normal (multiple forms of cancer) and across several tissue types   FANTOM  promoters   DNase hypersensitive sites   miRNA promoter regions   ~ 90% of content contained on the Illumina HumanMethylation27 BeadChip Streamlined Workflow The HumanMethylation450 BeadChip follows  user-friendly, streamlined workflow that does not require PCR. Its low sample input requirement (as low as 500 ng), enables analysis of valuable samples Infinium  HumanMethylation450 BeadChip The ideal solution for affordable, large sample size genome-wide DNA methylation studies. Figure : Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip The Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip features more than 450,000 methylation sites, within and outside of CpG islands. 4305493023\n\nData Sheet: Epigenetics derived from limited DNA sources. HumanMethylation450 BeadChip kits contain all required reagents for performing methylation analyses (except for the bisulfite conversion kit, which is available separately). Data Integration Of all the genes represented on the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, more than 20,000 are also present on the HumanHT-12 v4 Expression BeadChip2, permitting combined analysis of global methylation status and gene expression levels. In addition, investigators may integrate methylation data with genotyping data from GWAS studies to better understand the interplay between genotype and methylation state in driving phe- notypes of interest. High-Quality Data The HumanMethylation450 BeadChip applies both Infinium  and II assay chemistry technologies (Figure ) to enhance the depth of cover- age for methylation analysis. The addition of the Infinium II design allows use of degenerate oligonucleotide probes for  single bead type, en- abling each of up to three underlying CpG sites to be either methylated or unmethylated with no impact on the result for the queried site. Illumina scientists rigorously test every product to ensure strong and reproducible performance, enabling researchers to achieve industry- leading data quality. Precision and Accuracy Reproducibility has been determined based on the correlation of results generated from technical replicates. The HumanMethylation450 BeadChip showed strong correlation between replicates (>.98), as well as with the HumanMethylation27 BeadChip and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (Figure ). Sensitivity By comparing the results of replicate experiments (duplicates of eight biological samples), Illumina scientists have shown that the HumanMethylation450 BeadChip reliably detects  delta-beta value of . with  lower than % false positive rate. Internal Quality Controls Infinium HD based assays possess several sample-dependent and sample-independent controls so researchers have confidence in pro- ducing the highest quality data. The HumanMethylation450 BeadChip includes 600 negative controls, which are particularly important in methylation analysis assays since sequence complexity is decreased after bisulfite conversion. The GenomeStudio  Methylation Module Software has an integrated Controls Dashboard where the perfor- mance of all controls can be easily monitored. Figure : Broader Coverage Using Infinium  and II Assay Designs The HumanMethylation450 BeadChip employs both Infinium  and Infinium II assays, enhancing its breadth of coverage. Infinium  assay design employs two bead types per CpG locus, one each for the methylated and unmethylated states. The Infinium II design uses one bead type, with the methylated state determined at the single base extension step after hybridization.

Integrated Analysis Software HumanMethylation450 BeadChip data analysis is supported by the powerful and intuitive GenomeStudio Methylation Module, enabling researchers to effortlessly perform differential methylation analysis (Figure ). The GenomeStudio software features advanced visualiza- tion tools that enable researchers to view vast amounts of data in  single graph, such as heat maps, scatter plots, and line plots. These tools and the GenomeStudio Genome Browser display valuable infor- mation such as chromosomal coordinates, percent GC, location in  CpG Island, and methylation   values. Data generated by the Infinium HD methylation assay are easily compatible with data from other Illumina applications, including gene expression profiling. This enables researchers to perform cross- application analysis such as the integration of gene expression data with HumanMethylation450 BeadChip methylation data. Methylation Studies with FFPE Samples Researchers can perform methylation studies on FFPE samples by using  special, modified version of the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip protocol3 that leverages the easy-to-use Infinium FFPE DNA Restoration Solution4, to produce robust, highly reproducible results (Table ). The FFPE DNA Restoration Solution includes the Illumina FFPE QC and the Infinium HD FFPE DNA Restore Kits. Please note that while the FFPE DNA Restoration Solution and HumanMethyl- ation450 BeadChip kits are the same for normal and FFPE samples, investigators running FFPE samples should only follow the workflow described in the Infinium HD FFPE Methylation Assay protocol (manual or automated),, as it includes important changes to the standard protocols for each kit.

Previous studies have identified miRNAs that regulate rodent responses to spaceflight in low-Earth orbit, and we have confirmed the expression of these proposed spaceflight-associated miRNAs in rodents reacting to simulated spaceflight conditions. Moreover, astronaut samples from the NASA Twins Study confirmed these expression signatures in miRNA sequencing, single- cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq) data. Additionally,  subset of these miRNAs (miR-125, miR-16, and let-7a) was found to regulate vascular damage caused by simulated deep space radiation. To demonstrate the physiological relevance of key spaceflight-associated miRNAs, we utilized antagomirs to inhibit their expression and successfully rescue simulated deep-space-radiation-mediated damage in human 3D vascular constructs.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nIn Brief Malkani et al. uncover the role of circulating microRNAs as both  potential biomarker for health risks associated with spaceflight and  countermeasure to mitigate the damage caused to the body by the space environment. INTRODUCTION Humans and vertebrate organisms exhibit  unique set of biological responses to the space environment, including bone and muscle atrophy (Burkhart et al., 2019; Gerbaix et al., 2017), immune dysfunction (Baqai et al., 2009), neurobehavioral changes (Ronca et al., 2019), vision impairment (Mader et al., 2011), and cardiovascular damage (Elgart et al., 2018). Ionizing radiation (IR) and microgravity are the main biological stressors in low- Earth orbit (LEO), which is the region encompassed by the Earth  magnetosphere where all crewed missions currently occur. Although exposure to deep space radiation, which is primarily composed of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs), is reduced within LEO due to the magnetosphere, IR still poses  risk to astronauts in LEO, and GCRs are  critical health risk in the upcoming lunar and Mars missions (Townsend, 2005). Thus, combining LEO experiments with ground-based analogs of spaceflight stressors, including simulated GCRs, allows investigations into the mechanisms behind biological responses to spaceflight. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short (~22 nucleotides long) sequences of non-coding RNA that can regulate gene expression at the transcriptional and translational level and interact Malkani et al.

Therefore, identifying miRNAs (and their networks) that are shared between humans and model organisms in response to spaceflight stressors could reveal targets for biomarker and countermeasure development to reduce the associated health risks. Previously, we used spaceflown rodent RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets from the NASA GeneLab database to make unbiased predictions about miRNAs potentially involved in regulating the transcriptional response to spaceflight (Beheshti et al., 2018). The datasets analyzed in that study are described in the STAR Methods. Our analysis identified  set of 13 spaceflight-associated miRNAs that were predicted to drive  systemic response and suggested transforming growth factor (TGF)-  as an overarching regulator of their expression (Beheshti et al., 2018). TGF-  is  major regulatory cytokine mediating the progression of cancer (Rooke and Crosier, 2001), autoimmunity (Marie et al., 2006), and neuroinflammation (Cekanaviciute et al., 2014). However, it is important to note that this spaceflight-associated miRNA signature was defined computationally, based on transcriptomic analysis, and not measured experimentally. Here, we experimentally validated the predicted spaceflight-associated miRNA signature by quantifying circulating miRNAs in serum from rodents exposed to simulated spaceflight conditions: microgravity, partial gravity, LEO-relevant IR, simulated deep space radiation, and combined exposures to reduced gravity and simulated space radiation, as well as true spaceflight in LEO. We supported spaceflight-stressor-mediated changes in the expression of the predicted miRNAs by performing agnostic miRNA-seq in selected datasets, and our experimental validation also incorporated simulated deep space radiation conditions to help evaluate the extent to which the miRNA signature may be shared by different space environments. Finally, we addressed the human relevance of our findings by analyzing miRNAs released by irradiated human immune cells ex vivo and miRNA expression changes in astronauts from the NASA Twins Study in vivo (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). We expanded our initial panel of 13 candidate miRNAs (Beheshti et al., 2018) to include 15 target miRNAs with the following justifications: () miRNA let- was subdivided into two more specific family members (let-7a and let-7c) identified in recent space biology studies (Re en et al., 2014; Wei et al., 2018), and () an additional miRNA (miR-92a) was added after analyzing astronaut data from the NASA Twins Study. Furthermore, we investigated the potential downstream effects of spaceflight-associated human miRNAs using single-cell RNA (scRNA) sequencing of  targeted gene panel of leukocyte-depleted fractions in the NASA Twins Study (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019). Specifically, we compared gene expression in cells collected within  days upon spaceflown twin  (TW) return to his preflight and postflight samples, as well as control samples taken from the ground control twin (HR). Single-cell transcriptomics also let us determine the individual cell types that display the strongest perturbations in gene expression consistent with miRNA signatures identified in bulk transcriptomics, and single-cell assay for transposase accessible chromatin Malkani et al.

RESULTS Predicted Spaceflight miRNA Signature in Rodents Was Validated Using Simulated Microgravity and Deep Space Radiation To validate the predicted spaceflight-associated miRNA panel, we quantified their changes in response to ground analogs of individual spaceflight stressors in rodent models: simulated microgravity using hindlimb unloading (HU) (Morey-Holton and Globus, 1998) as well as IR using either gamma rays or major components of galactic cosmic rays protons and/or high mass and charge 56Fe particles (deep space relevant exposure) (Mewaldt, 1994). We exposed male 16-week-old C57BL/6J mice to HU, IR, or their combination and measured the set of selected 15 miRNAs in their serum at  or 11 days post-exposure using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) (Hindson et al., 2013). Euclidean clustering of serum miRNA concentrations separated the miRNAs into two main clusters: () deep-space-radiation-associated clusters, which are significantly regulated by 56Fe IR and 56Fe IR in combination with HU; and () microgravity-associated clusters, primarily altered in HU-only conditions (Figures 1A 1C). An additional subset of miRNAs was significantly increased in mouse serum only, early ( day) after exposure to the combination of mixed proton/56Fe irradiation and HU, but was not affected by individual stressors (Figure 1A). Of note, we have provided  discussion regarding potential hemolysis that might occur with the serum/plasma samples utilized throughout this manuscript in the STAR Methods. Most miRNAs (with the exception of miR-217) were observed to increase with radiation dose and linear energy transfer (LET; gamma < 150 MeV proton < 600 MeV/ 56Fe) in mouse serum both at  day and 11 days post-IR. At 11 days post-IR, the only significant miRNA increases were observed in IR-only (no HU) mice irradiated with either  Gy or  Gy 600 MeV/ 56Fe or  Gy protons (Figures 1A and 1B). In combination, these results indicate that the miRNA signature is mainly driven by the particle radiation component, which is proportional to dose and LET. Based on all miRNAs that were significantly different in spaceflight-associated conditions, we predicted the top 50 targeted genes (Figure 1D), key diseases regulated by the miRNAs (Figure 1E), and significant pathways (Figures 1F, 1G, and S1). The top 50 genes targeted by these miRNAs (Figure 1D) primarily regulate cell-cycle pathways and protein kinase activity, in addition to hematopoiesis and blood cell development (Figures 1F and S1). The majority of diseases regulated by these miRNAs are related to cancer (Figure 1E), though we also uncovered other diseases associated with spaceflight, including cardiovascular (green circles), neurological (yellow circles) and digestive disorders (purple circles), and muscular degeneration (orange circles) (Figure 1E). Similarly, key significantly regulated pathways include carcinogenesis as well as TGF-  signaling, which supports our previous prediction of TGF-  as  key regulator of spaceflight-associated miRNA functions and implies downstream carcinogenic and immune effects. Finally, the pathways also include Malkani et al. Page  Cell Rep.",

To examine the contribution of reduced gravity to the miRNA signature at higher resolution,  partial weight bearing (PWB) Wistar male rat model (Mortreux et al., 2018) was used to simulate varying degrees of gravitational loading. We observed that decreasing amounts of gravitational loading increased the quantities of miRNAs of interest, suggesting  gravity- dependent dose response (Figures 2A 2C). These results also validated  reduced-gravity- specific miRNA signature in both mice and rats and separated the miRNAs associated with reduced gravity from those associated with exposure to simulated deep space radiation in mice. The only observed exception was miR-217, which did not change. similar miRNA dose response was observed based on correlation with muscle mass (Figure 2D): the miRNAs of interest increased with reduced muscle mass (which is associated with lower simulated gravity both in this rat model and in astronauts). Notably, this model included two control groups of animals exposed to full gravitational loading: no harness (NH) and full harness (FH) (Figures 2A and 2B). Both conditions had been included in prior studies, and no functional or phenotypical differences were recorded, although there was  difference in miRNA expression between NH and FH 100% gravity groups (Figures 2A and 2B), possibly due to  trend in reduction in muscle mass in FH controls (not significant). Therefore, further comparison between groups included only the FH control (Figure 2C). Predicted Spaceflight miRNA Signature Was Partially Observed in Serum from Mice Exposed to LEO Next, we investigated whether the spaceflight-environment-linked miRNA signature is distinguishable in true spaceflight samples, using serum from young and old female BALB/ cAnNTac mice flown to the International Space Station (ISS) on Rodent Research Mission . In contrast with the simulated spaceflight cohorts, these mice experienced short-lasting hypergravity during takeoff and landing in addition to microgravity while in orbit, spent  days reacclimating on ground after the flight before sample collection, and received  significantly lower dose of IR than simulation experiments: .01128 Gy over approximately 30 days on the ISS. Although the combined mouse cohort did not exhibit any significantly increased miRNAs compared to basal (no spaceflight, normal housing conditions) controls (Figure 2E), when the samples were separated by age (Figures 2F and 2G), we observed clustering between spaceflight and basal controls in the older group (31 37 weeks at sacrifice) corresponding to middle-age in humans, which is more representative of typical astronaut cohorts, and no detectable clustering in the younger group (10 16 weeks at sacrifice) (Figures 2H 2J). Considering that these mice had  days to reacclimate to ground conditions before the samples were collected, these results may suggest that it takes longer for serum miRNA levels to return to basal levels in older mice, while younger mice recover faster. This finding is consistent with our prior results from simulated spaceflight studies, in which miRNA levels in irradiated mice start to return to control by 11 days following an over-100-fold- higher dose of IR than received by the spaceflown mice (Figure 1A).

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nAnother notable result from this spaceflight experiment is the correlation between organ weights and miRNA concentration in spaceflight mice and basal controls. Normalized to total body weight, adrenal gland weight increases with concentration of the majority of quantified miRNAs, and, conversely, brain weight decreases with increasing miRNA concentrations. While these correlations are not statistically significant, they suggest the possibility of lingering impacts on specific organs (Figure 2K). Increases in adrenal gland weight might be related to chronic stress, since the adrenal gland regulates stress responses (Ulrich-Lai et al., 2006) that have been previously associated with increased systemic corticosterone levels during spaceflight (Pecaut et al., 2017). Meanwhile,  volumetric reduction of brain features has been observed in cosmonauts (Pechenkova et al., 2019), though the physiological relevance of these findings remains to be elucidated. Since systemic increases in corticosterone levels also lead to reduced brain weight (Coburn-Litvak et al., 2004), chronic stress might be an underlying factor behind both adrenal gland and brain results, and future studies are needed to examine miRNA as its potential biomarker. Spaceflight-Relevant miRNA Signature Was Also Identified in Agnostic Sequencing Study of Simulated-Spaceflight-Exposed Mice To understand the specificity and variation of spaceflight-relevant miRNA levels within the global miRNA population, miRNA-seq was performed on tissue samples from 16-week-old female C57BL/6J mice after exposure to simulated spaceflight conditions: normal loading (NL) or HU for  weeks prior to irradiation with  Gy gamma,  Gy simulated solar particle event (simSPE), . Gy simulated simplified galactic cosmic rays (SimGCRSim), or sham control. SimGCRSim consists of five ions: protons at 1000 MeV, 28Si at 600 MeV/, 4He at 250 MeV/, 16O at 350 MeV/, 56Fe at 600 MeV/, and protons at 250 MeV (Simonsen et al., 2020). This dose of radiation is equivalent to what an astronaut is predicted to receive in deep space during  Mars mission, though it is modeled as  single exposure over 25 min instead of the actual chronic exposures over . years. Simulated solar particle event (SimSPE) irradiation consists of protons from 50 MeV to 150 MeV. Twenty-four hours after irradiation, the mice were sacrificed, and miRNA-seq was performed on tissue samples from the plasma, heart, liver, and soleus muscle. We observed highly variable miRNA expression profiles between organs, with the exception of heart and soleus muscle (Figures 3A and 3B). This variation underscores the importance of establishing  circulating systemic miRNA signature that can be measured in plasma, which is the most accessible source for biomarker evaluation in spaceflight conditions. Additionally, the high correlation between miRNA expression changes in heart and soleus muscle unsurprisingly suggests that the damage in these muscle tissues may be driven by similar changes in miRNAs (Figures 3A and 3B). Notably, miRNA-seq profiles from plasma also are more heterogeneous than those from individual organs, suggesting that plasma miRNA quantification might allow  more finely tuned spaceflight signature that could differentiate between different types of exposures or provide personalized risk assessment (Figures 3A and 3B). Comparison of significantly regulated miRNAs identified four miRNAs that are increased in all organs in the GCR+HU ( combined spaceflight stressors ) group compared to sham Malkani et al. Page  Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 September 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nNL ( no spaceflight stressors  control) (Figure 3C). Therefore, we decided to focus on the GCR+HU irradiated group for further analysis. We computed the top 20 genes regulated by the four common differentially expressed miRNAs (Figure 3D) as well as the pathways that were significantly regulated by these genes (Figure 3E) and found potential cardiovascular as well as systemic circulatory targets (Figure 3E). We next quantified miRNA fold changes between GCR/SPE/Gamma+HU and sham NL conditions, focusing on the panel of spaceflight-associated miRNAs (top 15) as well as the four additional miRNAs that were found to be shared among all tissues for GCR+HU versus NL by miRNA-seq (bottom ) (Figure 3F). Additional data is available in  companion paper (Wuu et al., 2020). We observed trends or significance for multiple spaceflight miRNAs, and the same miRNA family members differentially expressed across multiple tissues. For example, for miRNA-503-5p, expression was decreased in the liver, soleus, and heart but strongly increased in plasma (Figure 3F), indicating potential organ-dependent miRNA changes with the key systemic stressor response stemming from the circulating miRNAs. MiR-503 belongs to the miR-16 extended family (Caporali and Emanueli, 2011; Wang et al., 2019), which is one of the miRNAs predicted to be involved in the spaceflight response (Figure 1A) and impacts cardiovascular diseases through the inhibition of angiogenesis (Besnier et al., 2019; Caporali and Emanueli, 2011). Finally, we performed pathway analysis utilizing the miRNA-seq data with C2 curated gene sets from MSigDB on the miRNA-seq data and displayed all significantly regulated pathways (Figure 3G) for the liver and soleus muscle. Data for the plasma and heart tissues are in companion papers and show similar results (Paul et al., 2020; Wuu et al., 2020), and the pathways that showed suppression (false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted  value < .25; Figure 3G) have been previously implicated in cardiovascular adaptations to spaceflight (Beheshti et al., 2018, 2019). These specific pathways were selected for the countermeasure experiments (below). This experiment demonstrates that although the individual response of the miRNAs might not be significantly regulated, the global response of miRNAs on downstream gene targets reveals regulation by miRNAs belonging to the spaceflight signature. Spaceflight-Associated Rodent miRNA Signature Was Partially Shared by Human Responses Ex Vivo and In Vivo We next show that spaceflight-associated miRNA signature is partially conserved in human samples that had been exposed to real or simulated space environment conditions. First, we analyzed human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) responses to . Gy 600 MeV/ 56Fe particles that form  biologically significant component of GCRs, using PBMCs isolated from 12 healthy human (non-astronaut) donors. Thus, this experiment simulated deep-space-relevant radiation, without simulating microgravity. We observed an increase in spaceflight-associated miRNAs in the supernatant of irradiated PBMCs  hours, post- irradiation (Figures 4A 4D), as well as  positive correlation with increasing donor BMI and cell number (Figures 4B and 4D; Table S3) . Finally, in order to assess the impact of the real spaceflight environment on human cells, we analyzed miRNA-sequence data on total PBMC and lymphocyte-depleted (LD) samples Malkani et al. Page  Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 September 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nfrom the NASA Twins Study. This study involved actual LEO (low-LET radiation and microgravity) exposure for 340 days for  total of 146.34 mSv (or .1463 Gy). Unsorted PBMCs isolated during and after LEO spaceflight showed persistent changes in miRNA expression for the astronaut in space, which partially follows the predicted spaceflight signature (Figure 4E). Similarly, LD cells sampled before and after flight also indicated persistent changes in miRNA expression, though not all miRNAs behaved as predicted by the spaceflight signature (Figure 4F). Notably, the spaceflown twin (TW) had consistently higher expression of the miRNA target genes compared to the HR even at baseline/preflight, despite having higher levels of miRNAs as well (Figures 4E and 4F); thus, TW pre-flight levels were considered  better control than ground control twin (HR) pre-flight levels. This difference in miRNA expression is not surprising, due to known discordant miRNA expression profiles in twins (Xiao et al., 2019). Of the miRNAs found in the irradiated PBMC panel, only miR-92a-3p was significantly downregulated and let-7c-5p was upregulated in the TW miRNA-sequence data (Figure 4F). However, the downstream targets of the irradiation-associated miRNAs were significantly decreased between preflight and postflight samples, except the targets of hsa-miR-92a-3p and hsa-miR-26a-5p.",

Of the miRNAs found in the irradiated PBMC panel, only miR-92a-3p was significantly downregulated and let-7c-5p was upregulated in the TW miRNA-sequence data (Figure 4F). However, the downstream targets of the irradiation-associated miRNAs were significantly decreased between preflight and postflight samples, except the targets of hsa-miR-92a-3p and hsa-miR-26a-5p. This suggests that there was an increase in some irradiation-associated miRNA functions in TW, and the effects of miR-92a-3p and miR-26a-5p were more acute than the other miRNAs. Similar to the lack of response of miR-217 in animal models based on ddPCR results, miR-217 only had three targets within the targeted panel, none of which were significantly changed by spaceflight, indicating that miR-217, although implicated by original unbiased in silico predictions, does not respond to the stress of the space environment. We next analyzed the changes in miRNA expression across different blood cell populations that were associated with spaceflight-mediated miRNA differences in the same NASA Twins Study. Specifically, we conducted targeted scRNA-seq and scAb-seq (epitope mapping) of LD Twins Study samples across multiple time points. In total, 23,408 cells were sequenced across 12 samples:  TW and  HR (Figure S2 and Table S4). Cell types were identified on  per cluster basis by both RNA and epitope levels (Figure 5A). Module scores for the targets of the subset of spaceflight-associated miRNAs that were found to be upregulated in irradiated human PBMCs were calculated using Seurat and compared among TW preflight, return, and postflight samples (Figures 5B 5N). When the cell population was split by cell type, we observed that the changes in miRNA- mediated gene expression were highly variable across cell types (Figure 5O). Dividing each cell type into ground, preflight, return, and postflight groups demonstrated that individual cell types were differentially affected by spaceflight-associated miRNAs. For example, CD14+ and CD16+ monocytes responded differently to hsa-miR-92a-3p: CD14+ monocytes showed decreased expression of hsa-miR-92a-3p targets, while CD16+ monocytes expressed higher levels of hsa-miR-92a-3p target genes upon return compared to either preflight or postflight. Progenitor (circulating hematopoietic stem) cells stood out in this analysis, as expression of the spaceflight-associated miRNA target genes increased specifically at the return time point. These differences among cell types indicate that immune cell composition Malkani et al. Page  Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 September 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nmay play  role in the downstream effects of spaceflight-associated miRNA increases and suggest return to Earth as  major stressor affecting miRNA expression. The Increase in Expression of Spaceflight-Associated miRNAs Is Not Driven by Epigenetic Changes To determine whether the changes in miRNA expression were due to spaceflight-induced chromatin changes, we used scATAC-seq on 11,344 cells (Figure S3 and Table S5). SnapTools and SnapATAC were used to create -kb bins across the genome and determine genome accessibility based on ATAC activity per cell, and then genes and miRNAs were assigned the ATAC activity based on the overlapping bin. ATAC activity is associated with chromatin accessibility, which can be used to determine whether the miRNAs upregulated in irradiated PBMCs were differently accessible in TW during spaceflight (Figure 6B). Of note, open chromatin peaks were observed at let-7c-5p, miR-34a-5p, miR-125b-5p, let-7a-5p, and miR-146a-5p. Furthermore, both control PBMCs and HR ground PMBCs displayed consistent ATAC peaks across the majority of the miRNA loci. Together, this suggests that the chromatin around these miRNA loci is open but not strongly affected by spaceflight. In addition, we assessed ATAC activity in different cell types (Figures 6C and 6D). The module score and dot plots of the miRNAs upregulated in irradiated PBMCs demonstrate that CD14+ monocytes and pre-dendritic cells (pDCs) show more miRNA accessibility that other cell populations (Figures 6C and 6D), indicating that chromatin states depend more on immune cell type than spaceflight. We next investigated immune cell composition at different time points during flight, specifically the proportion of CD14+ monocytes. Due to  low number of cells in the TW preflight sample, data from ATAC-seq and scRNA-seq experiments were combined to determine the immune cell distribution in LD fractions. (Figure 6E). Notably, the TW return samples had the highest proportion of CD14+ monocytes. This result, combined with the scRNA-seq of downstream targets, suggests that miRNA expression during spaceflight is regulated not by chromatin accessibility, but by immune cell distribution, and is particularly high in CD14+ monocytes. Finally, we evaluated whether specific ATAC peak changes correlated with expression levels from the Twins Study miRNA-seq (Figures 6F and 6G). However, ATAC activity was observed in the HR samples for upregulated miRNAs, indicating that the chromatin was already open prior to spaceflight. Selective Inhibition of Spaceflight-Associated miRNAs Reduces Cardiovascular Damage in  Human Tissue Model after Exposure to Simulated Deep Space Radiation Finally, we developed and utilized  mature human 3D microvascular tissue model (Grabham et al., 2011; Templin et al., 2016; Wuu et al., 2020) seeded with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to examine the physiological effects of the candidate miRNAs on structural cardiovascular damage caused by heavy ion irradiation (Grabham et al., 2011; unpublished data). Forty-eight hours after irradiation with . Gy SimGCRSim, several of the candidate miRNAs showed marked increases compared to controls (Figure 7A), though the increases were not significant, possibly due to low sample numbers. Malkani et al. Page 10 Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 September 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nThree of the miRNAs (miR-125, miR-16, and let-7a) that were increased by SimGCRSim irradiation were also previously predicted to be associated with space-radiation-induced cardiovascular damage (Beheshti et al., 2019) and were chosen to be inhibited using antagomirs (Kr tzfeldt et al., 2005). Further data showing that these miRNAs are associated with disrupted angiogenesis following IR have been reported elsewhere (Wuu, et al., 2020). In addition, these miRNAs show consistent presence and impact on downstream functions in the space environment (.., Twins Study data) compared to all other miRNAs. Antagomirs were applied 24  before irradiation, and morphology of the tissue constructs was assessed 48  after irradiation with . Gy SimGCRSim. We observed irradiation-mediated loss of vascularization because the microvessels had shrunk or collapsed, indicating that . Gy SimGCRSim is sufficient to disrupt microvessels. This impact of SimGCRSim exposure was reversed by application of the three antagomirs 24  before irradiation, while  scrambled antagomir control did not induce the rescue phenotype (Figures 7B and 7C). Based on the summary of the of spaceflight-stressor-induced changes across all miRNAs (Figure 7D) and the miRNAs that have global significant impact on the downstream gene targets determined in Figure 3D (Figure 7E), it is apparent that these three miRNAs have  uniform trend across all different conditions (red shaded miRNAs in Figures 7D and 7E). Thus, microvessel structure was protected by selectively inhibiting three miRNAs that are the most universally associated with spaceflight responses, proving that the vascular impairments caused by simulated deep space radiation are at least partially mediated through miRNAs and in the future might be rescued using antagomirs in human tissue constructs. Future steps to further explore the impact of this potential countermeasure will be performed in murine models and are currently ongoing. Although the results with the antagomirs are promising in the in vitro model, we still cannot account for the complexity in an in vivo model and the efficacy of this treatment. DISCUSSION In summary, we have validated the previously predicted panel of candidate spaceflight- relevant miRNAs using  combination of spaceflight, simulated microgravity, partial gravity, and simulated deep space radiation conditions in male and female mouse and rat in vivo, astronaut, and human ex vivo models. The majority of rodent serum miRNAs followed the pattern of dose-dependent increase in response to IR, with the notable exception of miR-217 (Figures 7D and 7E). We evaluated the applicability of this miRNA signature to humans by examining miRNA content in the supernatant of primary human immune cell samples exposed to simulated deep space radiation, as well as immune cells from the NASA Twins Study, and observed partial conservation across species. The functional significance of key miRNAs was predicted by analyzing miRNA-dependent changes in gene expression at the single-cell level in the NASA Twins Study and experimentally evaluated utilizing antagomirs to mitigate vascular damage caused by simulated deep space radiation in  3D human microvascular tissue model. When viewing these results independently, it may appear that some level of variability occurs for the miRNA between the different conditions (Figures , , , and ), but when observing all conditions together, this variability is in fact accounted for, based on which component of the space environment is being observed. summary of how all the miRNA patterns and downstream targets demonstrate the Malkani et al. Page 11 Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 September 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nconsistency over all the models utilized for this study is shown in Figures 7D and 7E. For example, certain miRNAs (.., let-7a-5p, let-7c-5p, miR-223-3p) are more significantly regulated with microgravity experiments as opposed space radiation experiments, while other miRNAs (.., miR-16-5p) are consistently being expressed in all conditions (Figure 7D). Collectively, our samples identify two spaceflight miRNA signatures, the first associated with reduced gravity and LEO and the second representing the responses to simulated deep space radiation. Specifically, gamma-irradiated mice, sham HU mice, PWB rats, ISS- flown mice, and the Twins Study data collectively display  LEO/microgravity miRNA signature, while 600 MeV/ 56Fe and proton-irradiated mice, human PBMCs, and human 3D microvascular tissue models exposed to 600 MeV/ 56Fe ions and simplified simulated GCRs show  deep-space-radiation-dependent signature (Figure 7D). Notably, significant overlaps exist between both signatures, indicating  miRNA panel that might be particularly relevant to future lunar and Mars missions that will combine both stressors. The absence of significant differences in miRNA-217 expression in these datasets serves as  negative control and demonstrates that the responses that had been observed in the remaining candidate miRNAs are unlikely to be caused by universal miRNA increases induced by an arbitrary stressor. miRNA signature unique to the spaceflight response has potential uses as  biomarker of systemic biological damage as well as  source for targets for mitigating the health risks caused by spaceflight and deep space radiation. While specific miRNAs have previously been implicated in spaceflight-associated biological damage (Girardi et al., 2014; Simone et al., 2009; Teodori et al., 2019), recent systems biology studies indicate that using an entire miRNA network as  biomarker can provide  more robust association with biological changes (Beheshti et al., 2017). In addition, we have observed that individual components of the space environment have unique miRNA signatures: some miRNAs are associated with the microgravity component of real or simulated spaceflight, others are associated with exposure to deep space radiation, and still others are only significantly increased after exposure to both, suggesting that different miRNA-based biomarkers would be applicable to different conditions, with the latter being particularly important in deep space exploration. The sensitivity of miRNA responses is underscored by the fact that the magnitude of miRNA increases appears to be dose dependent for both radiation and microgravity, as observed in the mouse simulated space environment model and the PWB rat model, respectively.",

The sensitivity of miRNA responses is underscored by the fact that the magnitude of miRNA increases appears to be dose dependent for both radiation and microgravity, as observed in the mouse simulated space environment model and the PWB rat model, respectively. Similarly, for the IR component, the signature is also LET dependent, as we report more significant miRNA changes after 600 MeV/ 56Fe compared to proton or gamma irradiation, which suggests its potential relevance for future deep space missions. Finally, conserved increases of key miRNAs across species, sexes, and experiments emphasizes the reliability of the miRNA signature. Since the majority of the data in this paper are from males, there can be sex-specific differences that are not captured here. It has been shown that certain miRNAs and family members of miRNAs are significantly expressed in one sex over the other, in normal and cancerous (.., The Cancer Genome Atlas) tissues (Guo et al., 2017). For example, miR-503 is linked to female-related cardiovascular disease (Florijn et al., 2018), indicating Malkani et al. Page 12 Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 September 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nthat miRNAs in the same family have similar behaviors in different sexes while still linked to the original family of miRNAs. Future research will need to explore the sex differences and the spaceflight signatures for specific miRNAs as well as related miRNA family members. Of note, miRNA signatures may be applied for improving astronaut health by providing the first step toward identifying  network of circulating regulatory molecules that are activated by spaceflight. Identifying, validating and targeting such systemic regulatory networks, as opposed to addressing symptomatic damage in isolated organs and tissues, may accelerate our ability to mitigate the damage to several organ systems at once. Additionally, this approach may be used for preemptive risk reduction. Indeed, we experimentally demonstrated the countermeasure potential of miRNAs by using antagomirs to inhibit three miRNAs associated with spaceflight cardiovascular health risks in human 3D tissue models. In general, antagomirs are  powerful tool for preventing the downstream effects of miRNA, which can be extensive due to the ability of  single miRNA to interact with hundreds of genes at the transcriptional, translational, and protein levels (Kr tzfeldt et al., 2005). Antagomirs have been shown to effectively inhibit their miRNA targets in vivo in mouse models of disease; however, more research is required for understanding their off-target effects and tissue specificity (Ishida and Selaru, 2013). In our model, antagomirs were applied as  countermeasure prior to deep-space-relevant irradiation and successfully prevented microvascular damage. Thus, our suggested network of miRNAs and their implied targets not only provides mechanistic insight into spaceflight-induced organ damage, but also may be  valuable platform for preventing the adverse health effects of spaceflight. However, in our experiments, the antagomir therapy was only applied against the cardiovascular component of the miRNA signature due to the model only recapitulating human microvasculature. It would be important to measure the effects of miRNA inhibition of the rest of the miRNA signature in  model that more fully captures spaceflight-mediated immune dysfunction and cancer progression as well as in vivo. The panel of spaceflight-associated miRNAs has been predicted to disrupt cell signaling and metabolic pathways, at least in part via their interactions with TGF-  (Beheshti et al., 2018). TGF-  is  pleiotropic cytokine that has been shown previously to be significantly modulated during spaceflight conditions (Jessup et al., 2000; Westerlind and Turner, 1995), and its expression has been successfully altered as  therapeutic approach in cancer and inflammation. However, TGF-  is involved in  wide variety of endothelial and immune cell processes, which makes it  risky target (Otten et al., 2010). Furthermore, given that TGF-  has been found to exert both tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting effects at different stages of tumorigenesis (Ikushima and Miyazono, 2010), the ability of miRNAs to target the TGF-  pathway at multiple specific sites may suggest  more effective and dynamic modulation of TGF-  effects than simple overexpression or inhibition (Butz et al., 2012). Thus, antagomir-mediated miRNA inhibition may allow more context-specific TGF-   pathway modulation and may be  promising countermeasure for spaceflight applications as well. Malkani et al. Page 13 Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 September 15.

Changes in these miRNAs during different stages of spaceflight likely contribute to the overall dysregulation of inflammation, which may persist long after astronauts return to Earth (Garrett-Bakelman et al., 2019) In general, miRNAs have yet to be studied extensively in the context of space biology. Previous rodent and human spaceflight (LEO) experiments that specifically examined miRNAs have been limited to in vitro cellular models (human fibroblasts and leukocytes), though some miRNAs (miR-34, miR-21, let-7a, and let-7c) identified in those studies do overlap with our proposed spaceflight signature (Hughes-Fulford et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016). Simulated microgravity studies in humans undergoing 21-day bedrest have also reported let-7a, let-7c, miR-25, miR-125b, and miR-92a from our panel (Rullman et al., 2016). Finally, simulated deep space radiation studies in mice have implicated miR-34 and miR-125 (Templin et al., 2012), which we have also observed in irradiated mouse serum. Further studies will be necessary to compare spaceflight-associated miRNA effects at the individual organ, tissue, and cellular levels and to explore potential sex differences. Although we have observed strong similarities in miRNA expression in cardiac and soleus muscles (Figures 7D and 7E), the miRNA content in these organs was not sufficient to explain the systemic changes in plasma miRNAs, indicating that other organs and tissues not quantified in this study may play  major role in miRNA expression. Therefore, there is  need for  more comprehensive and unbiased assessment of all miRNA through miRNA-seq in  wide range of tissues from each of the experimental models investigated here. In addition, scRNA-seq has indicated major changes in miRNA-associated gene expression among different blood immune cell types in the human blood from the NASA Twins Study (Gertz et al., 2020). CD14+ monocytes are particularly likely to express and respond to miRNAs, suggesting  potential regulatory role of miRNAs on the innate immune response that is known to be dysregulated in spaceflight (Crucian et al., 2011). Despite the demonstrated contribution of CD14+ monocytes to increases in the circulating miRNAs, it is also possible that the miRNAs could be coming from another organ where they are more abundantly expressed. Thus, further studies will be necessary to determine the exact origin of the increased miRNAs and tissue response, such as with cell-free DNA profiling (Bezdan et al., 2020), which will be beneficial for mapping and developing effective countermeasures. Finally, the successful prevention of vascular damage through antagomir therapy in our proof-of-concept human tissue model demonstrates the need for further experiments to fully characterize antagomir therapies in vivo to understand their clinical safety and efficacy and to examine which components of the spaceflight miRNA signature make effective targets for antagomir therapies.

We also demonstrate the potential for preventing biological damage by strategic inhibition of specific miRNAs with antagomirs. The immediate impact of this study is the first step toward developing  systemic miRNA signature as  novel space biology research metric for assessing spaceflight-induced damage in astronauts and animal models of true spaceflight as well as ground analogs, while its expected long-term outcome is revealing new avenues for spaceflight countermeasure development that modulates systemic effects rather than isolated organ damage.

All animals were individually housed. At 16 weeks of age, mice were exposed to  Gy gamma total body irradiation (137Cs at .83 Gy/min, JL Shepherd Mark , San Gabriel, CA). For this treatment, mice were housed individually in  custom animal holding cage, maintaining HU mice in  head-down position. Mice were placed in the irradiator chamber and exposed to total body irradiation. The unloading of mice was maintained during irradiation by custom small HU cages. Sham-irradiated controls were handled similarly and placed in the irradiation chamber with the radiation source turned off. Additional mouse serum was obtained from Dr. Yasaman Shirazi from  simulated microgravity and radiation study (Table S1). Eighty 16-week old C57BL/6J male mice (Jackson Laboratory Maine, BNL protocol Globus 2015 #481) were divided into seven groups: sham ( = 14), 1Gy proton irradiation (1H, 150 MeV/, LET ~.52 KeV/um) ( = ), 1Gy iron (56Fe, 600 MeV/, LET ~175 KeV/um) irradiation ( = ), 2Gy iron irradiation ( = ), 1Gy mixed iron and proton irradiation (1H/56Fe/1H at 25/50/25cGy) ( = 14), hindlimb unloaded (HU) ( = 14), and HU+1Gy mixed iron and proton irradiation ( = 14). Total body irradiations were carried out at NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) on conscious mice with 600 MeV/ 56Fe ( Gy), 150 MeV/ 1H (1Gy), or mixed beam (1H/56Fe/1H at 25/50/25cGy), maintaining respective hindlimb unloading (HU) or normal loading (NL) conditions. Mice were irradiated after  days of HU or NL, and maintained HU or NL for  or 11 days before being sacrificed. For both the above simulated microgravity and radiation studies, serum was isolated from blood draws from the vena cava of the mice. In order to prevent hemolysis from interfering in the results, the following protocol was uniformly conducted for all serum isolations: the blood was placed in  4mL EDTA coated blood collection tube (BD Vacutainer Lavender K2-EDTA Cat# 367861) and kept at room temperature for 30 mins to allow for clotting. Then, the tubes were centrifuged at 2000  for 15 minutes at   followed by immediate freezing of the aliquots at  80 . Samples were always mixed gently to prevent hemolysis. Partial weight bearing rat model: Partial weight bearing rat serum was donated by Dr. Marie Mortreux and Dr. Seward Rutkove from  previous study. All experimental protocols were approved by the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. 40 adult male Wistar rats (14 weeks of age at baseline, Charles River Malkani et al. Page 16 Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 September 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nLaboratories, Wilmington, MA) were assigned to  of  groups to ensure equal distribution of the body weights at baseline (428. .2g). Animals were assigned to either normal loading without apparatus (PWB100 ), normal loading with full harness (PWB100 FH), 70% of normal loading (PWB70), 40% of normal loading (PWB40), or 20% of normal loading (PWB20) for 28 consecutive days. Partial weight-bearing (PWB) was performed in custom cages using  quadrupedal unloading composed of  forelimb jacket and  pelvic harness and extensively described elsewhere (Mortreux et al., 2018). Across our 28-day study, the only significant difference between the NH and FH control groups was observed in weight gain where the 100% gravity NH group gained significantly more weight than the 100% gravity FH group. The weight gain was also associated with  slightly (but not significant) increased daily food intake that did not result in  different cumulative food intake throughout our study. The device did not exert any pressure nor prevented the animals from moving freely in their cage. Rats were singly housed in  room maintained at 22     with  12h:12h light-dark cycle starting at :00 am, and allowed 48 hours to acclimate before baseline. On day 28, animals were euthanized using CO2 inhalation per IACUC guidelines and blood was collected via cardiac puncture. Blood was allowed to clot at room temperature and was then centrifuged for 10 minutes at 10,000g. Serum was collected and frozen upon further analysis. animals per group were selected randomly to perform miRNA analysis, and are outlined in Table S1. ISS-flown mice: Serum was isolated from 36 space-flown female BALB/cAnNTac mice (Taconic) (Table S1). These mice were launched to the ISS on Rodent Research Reference Mission  (RRRM-)/Rodent Research Mission  (RR-) on 12/05/2018, docked to the ISS on 12/08/2018 and were returned to Earth as live animals on 01/13/2019,  total of 39 days after launch. The total absorbed radiation dose the mice received was 11.28mGy. The mice were sacrificed  days after returning to Earth. There were two different age groups, young ( = 18, 10-16 weeks) and old ( = 18, 31-37 weeks) as outlined in Table S1. Space irradiation and hindlimb unloading of mice for miRNA-sequencing: 15-week   -day old, C57BL/6J wild-type (Wt) female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and housed at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL, Upton, NY). Upon arrival to BNL, mice were quarantined and acclimated to  standard 12:12h light:dark cycle, with controlled temperature/humidity for -week prior to cage acclimation. Food and water were given ad libitum, and standard bedding was changed once per week. Mice were cage acclimated ( = 10 mice per group;  mice per cage to maintain social interaction) -days prior to HU, followed by 14-days either normally loaded (NL) or hindlimb unloaded (HU, see details below). Irradiation was administered on day 13 and blood tissues were collected at 24-hours post-irradiation and post-euthanasia by CO2 overdose, followed by cervical dislocation. Blood was collected via the abdominal aorta in EDTA-coated tubes (. ) and plasma was separated by centrifugation at ,000xg for 15 minutes. Plasma was collected and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for  80  storage. 100   aliquot of cellular fraction was flash frozen and stored at  80  for RNA analyses, while the remaining cellular fraction was lysed with 1x RBC lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by flow cytometric preparation and analyses, as describe below. The heart, liver, and soleus muscle were flash Malkani et al. Page 17 Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 September 15.

Body weight tracking was performed on days  , ,  and 14. Hindlimb unloading (HU) was performed using the adjusted Morey-Holton method for social housing ( =  per cage) (Tahimic et al., 2019). Briefly, mice were suspended from the tail using non-invasive traction tape attached to an adjustable pulley mounted on the top of  standard rodent cage. The adjustable nature of the device allows the user to position the animal in  head-down position (approximately 30  to the horizon) once attached. The crossbar height, lateral crossbar position, and chain length are adjustable. The pulley is free to move along the crossbar that spans the length of the top of the cage enabling the mouse to navigate freely on one half of the cage using its forepaws and to interact with the second mouse in the cage, without enabling ambulation of the limbs. Individual food and water sources are provided to each mouse and replaced daily. Control mice were housed in identical cages with normal ambulation. On day 13, mice were transported on BNL base to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility by animal care staff and were transferred to individual HU boxes. The following doses of irradiation were administered; simplified GCR sim (. Gy), SPE ( Gy), Gamma ( Gy) and Sham control ( Gy). Mice were positioned in the plateau region of the Bragg curve and irradiated at room temperature in individual HU boxes to enable whole body irradiation while maintaining hindlimb suspension. The NSRL physics staff performed the dosimetry. To simulate GCR, we used the simplified GCR simulation of ions, energy, and doses determined by  NASA consensus formula that consists of  ions: protons at 1000 MeV, 28Si at 600 MeV/, 4He at 250 MeV/, 16O at 350 MeV/, 56Fe at 600 MeV/, and protons at 250 MeV. This dose of radiation is equivalent to what an astronaut is predicted to receive in deep space during  Mars mission, though it is modeled as  single exposure over 25 minutes instead of the actual chronic exposures over . years. Further, GCR sim is  mixture of high and low LET ions in  ratio of 15% to 85%, respectfully. To simulate SPE, we used  total dose of 1Gy protons with energy ranges from 50MeV to 150MeV. For all irradiations  60x60 beam was utilized at NSRL. For radiation dose equivalence and biological reference, we used  Gy gamma irradiation with the cesium resource available at BNL, in the absence of HU due to resource limitations. Sham controls were treated similar to GCR/SPE irradiated mice, including HU cage boxes and beam line (without irradiation) for the same duration as GCR simualtion, .., 25 minutes. In vitro models Irradiated human PBMCs: Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from Dr. Sylvain Costes from  human irradiation sensitivity study (NASA HRP #NNJ16HP24I, NASA Ames Research Center Human Research IRB #HRI-357) (Table S1). Briefly, PBMCs were isolated from blood donated by 12 healthy adults:  females and  males. PBMC isolation was performed using Ficoll-Paque (VWR Cat# 95038-168) density gradient centrifugation followed by red blood cell lysis (VWR Cat# 420301-BL), and cells were frozen at 1x107 cells/mL until the day before irradiation. All subjects were of European descent and 20 - 64 years old. Malkani et al. Page 18 Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 September 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nCells were plated in 12-well plates (VWR Cat# 29442-040) 24 hours before irradiation in RPMI 1640 (Sigma Cat# R8758) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (VWR Cat# 1300-500H) and % Penicillin/Streptomycin/Glutamine (Fisher Cat# 10-378-016). Each well received approximately .6x106 cells and 2mL media. 24 hours later, the cells were irradiated with 0Gy or .3Gy 600MeV/ 56Fe. Cell supernatants were collected  hours after irradiation and stored at  80  until miRNA extractions. 3D human vascular model Mature human 3D microvascular tissue models are grown by seeding-human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Lonza Cat# CC-2519) into  collagen/matrigel mixture as described (Grabham et al., 2011). Briefly, HUVECs were first grown in EGM Endothelial Cell Growth Medium (Cat# CC-3124), then cells (   106/ml) were embedded into  collagen/matrigel mixture (Cat# 354236 and Cat# 356230). Microvessels are grown in EGM- Endothelial Cell Growth Medium (Cat# CC-3162) plus 50 nM Phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate: (PMA) (Cat# 524400) for  days to form tubular microvessels before irradiations. These tissue models were used to study vascular changes associated with specific miRNAs (Table S1). Irradiations were carried out at Brookhaven National Lab using 50cGy of SimGCRSim (-ion simplified galactic cosmic ray simulation: protons at 1000MeV, 28Si at 600 MeV/, 4He at 250 MeV/, 16O at 350 MeV/, 56Fe at 600 MeV/, and protons at 250 MeV). dose of . of each antagomir was administered to the appropriate groups 24 hours prior to irradiation. Prior work has shown that lentivirus particles efficiently incorporate into these constructs, therefore it was assumed that antagomirs would have no trouble either.",

The tissue constructs used for miRNA analysis were dissolved by submerging in TRIzol (ThermoFisher Cat# 15596026) 48 hours post irradiation, without any fixation or homogenization. Simulated GCR irradiation To simulate GCR, we used the simplified GCR simulation of ions, energy, and doses determined by  NASA consensus formula that consists of  ions: protons at 1000 MeV, 28Si at 600 MeV/, 4He at 250 MeV/, 16O at 350 MeV/, 56Fe at 600 MeV/, and protons at 250 MeV, in the following proportions; Protons 100MeV at 34.%, Si at .%, He at 18%,  at .%, 56Fe at %, and Protons 250 MeV at 39.%. This mixture is the simplified version of the full GCR simulation and represents the proportions of ions found in space and thus translates to exploratory class missions (Simonsen et al., 2020). The low LET particles (Protons and Helium) make up the majority of radiation although high LET ions generally have  greater RBE. NASA Twins study samples The NASA Twins Study involved two male twin subjects, aged 50 years old at the time of launch. The flight twin spent 340 days aboard the ISS while his identical twin stayed on Earth as the ground control. Malkani et al. Page 19 Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 September 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nBlood samples were collected into 4mL CPT tubes (BD Biosciences Cat # 362760) per manufacturer  recommendations. Cell separation was performed by centrifugation in at 1800   for 20 minutes at room temperature, both on the ISS and for the ground-based samples. Ambient blood collected samples slated for immediate return on Soyuz capsule were stored at   until processing (average of 35-37 hours after collection, including repatriation time). Samples collected on Earth and the ISS and planned for long-term storage were mixed by inversion and immediately frozen at  80 . Fresh processing of CPT tubes was performed using the following steps: . plasma was retrieved from the CPT tubes and flash frozen prior to long term storage at  80 . . The peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were recovered and washed in PBS. . million PBMCs were retrieved from one pre-flight and one post-flight samples, pelleted, flash frozen and stored at  80  until use for RNA extractions. The flow through from cell sorting steps was recovered as the lymphocyte depleted (LD) fraction; LD and PBMC cell specimens were lysed into RLT+ buffer (QIAGEN Cat# 1053393), flash frozen and stored at  80  until use. METHOD DETAILS Accounting for Hemolysis in Samples Although hemolysis is unavoidable for blood/serum samples obtained from in vivo studies similar to what is described throughout this manuscript, we believe that we have accounted for this to the best to our ability for our analysis. There are many papers discussing this topic and impact on circulating miRNAs with the conclusions from these papers stating that for in vivo samples hemolysis can  be avoided but procedures can be done to reduce the effects dramatically (Blondal et al., 2013; Pizzamiglio et al., 2017; Poel et al., 2018). Due the constraints for space biology experiments, the main step to reduce hemolysis variations for miRNAs is by handling all the samples identically. Both the controls and all other samples were handled under the exact same conditions throughout the manuscript. So if miRNAs levels would have been altered due to hemolyzed blood, then all miRNA levels would have been altered the same way between our comparisons. In fact in the negative controls all the miRNAs from our spaceflight signature are either nonexistent or at extremely low levels compared to samples under experimental conditions. This indicated that although it has been reported that hemolysis will alter miRNAs levels for all samples (Pizzamiglio et al., 2017), the levels of the miRNAs should have been altered identically in our controls and experimental conditions, allowing for reduced variability between results. miRNA extraction MiRNA extractions from serum, plasma, all tissues, and cell supernatants were carried out using the QIAGEN miRNeasy serum/plasma kit (#217184). MiRNA extractions from dissolved microvessel constructs were carried out using the QIAGEN miRNeasy Mini Kit (#217004). Quantitation of miRNA samples was done using  NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). Total RNA extraction from the NASA Twin Study LD and PBMC lysates was carried out using the QIAGEN Allprep kit (Cat# 80204). Quantitation of RNA was assessed using Qubit . (Invitrogen) per manufacturer  recommendations. RNA quality control was performed Malkani et al. Page 20 Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 September 15.

With the C1000 Touch Thermal Cycler with 96 Deep Well Reaction Module (Bio-Rad) the following PCR reaction was used for all the primers:  cycle 95  for  min, 40 cycles of 95  for 30  and 58  for  min (the annealing temperature can change depending on the primer),  cycle of   for  min, and  cycle of 90  for  min. Not all miRNA primers sets for ddPCR will have the same annealing temperature, so optimizing the annealing temperature is required for each primer set. Their respective annealing temperatures are found in Table S2. Finally, the QX200 Droplet Digital PCR System (Bio-Rad) quantified the amount of miRNA for each primer set per sample. QuantaSoft software (Bio-Rad) generated the data for each primer set and sample. The same threshold setting was used for all samples per primer set. The concentration (miRNA copies/ ) value generated by QuantaSoft was converted to miRNA copies/ng of serum. These values were used for all miRNA analysis. For all analysis the miRNA concentrations were log2(+) transformed to allow for easy comparison between miRNAs and samples. miRNA sequencing on murine samples Library construction and sequencing was performed from miRNAs isolated from plasma, liver, heart, and soleus muscle from the mouse experiments described above. The miRNA extraction was carried out using the QIAgen miRNeasy kit (#217004). The total RNA quality and quantity were analyzed using  Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, CA, USA) with RIN number > . Approximately    of total RNA was used to prepare small RNA library according to protocol of TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep Kits (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Single-end sequencing was performed using 50 bp on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 at the LC Sciences (Hangzhou, China) following the vendor  recommended protocol. All miRNA-sequence raw data was deposited on NASA  GeneLab data repository/platform with the following identifiers: for all heart tissue related data: GLDS-334,  for all liver tissue related data: GLDS-335,  for all soleus muscle related data: GLDS-337,  and for all plasma related data: GLDS-336,  miRNA sequencing on NASA Twins Study samples Small RNA libraries were prepared from 50 ng total RNA using the NEBNext  Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina  (NEB #E7560) per manufacturer  recommendations with the following modifications: adaptors and RT primer were diluted four fold, 17 cycles of PCR were used for library amplification, and no size selection was performed. The i7 primers in the NEBNext  Multiplex Oligos for Illumina  Dual Index Primers (NEB# E7600, Malkani et al. Page 21 Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 September 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nNEB#E7780) were used to supplement the index primers in NEB #E7560. The libraries were sequenced in an Illumina NextSeq instrument (1x50bp). Single cell RNA and epitope sequencing on NASA Twin Study samples Cells were isolated prepared using the BD Rhapsody platform according to the BD Rhapsody Express Single-Cell Analysis System Instrument User Guide, with  custom-designed RNA and epitope panel. Briefly, cells from each sample were labeled with sample tags, then pooled after being washed twice with FACS buffer. Combined samples were then washed an additional time before being stained with the BD AbSeq Ab-Oligo reagents. After staining, the cells were washed twice before resuspension at approximately 20,000 cells in 620  . These cells were then isolated using the Single-Cell Analysis System and cDNA Synthesis with the BD Rhapsody Express Single-Cell Analysis System using the manufacturers  protocol (BD Biosciences). Cells were loaded onto  BD Rhapsody nanowell cartridges. Cartridges were loaded with Cell Capture Beads (BD Biosciences) before shaking for 15  at ,000 rpm. Cells were lysed and cell capture beads were retrieved and washed prior to Exonuclease  treatment and reverse transcription. Targeted amplification of cDNA with the Human Immune Response Panel primers and custom supplemental panel (all targets listed in Table S3) was done through 10 PCR cycles. PCR products were purified, and mRNA and AbSeq products were separated by SPRIselect beads with double-sided selection. mRNA products were amplified further with 15 PCR cycles. Final libraries were indexed with  PCR cycles. Library quality was assessed by Bioanalyzer (D1000 HS, Agilent). Library DNA concentration was quantified using  Qubit dsDNA HS Kit (ThermoFisher, #Q32854) on  Qubit Fluorometer. Libraries were diluted to 2nM and multiplexed before being sequenced on three lanes of  Novaseq-6000. Mean read depth per cell was 13,244.31 mRNA reads per cell and 11,506.98 AbSeq reads per cell for  combined 243751.30 reads per cell. Single cell ATAC sequencing on NASA Twins Study samples Cells were isolated and prepared according to the SureCell ATAC-Seq Library Prep Kit User Guide (17004620, Bio-Rad) by the Weill Cornell Epigenomics Core. Briefly, lysis and tagmentation was performed simultaneously on the leukocyte depleted fraction of PBMC samples. Cells were washed before resuspension in Whole Cell Tagmentation Mix. Cells were tagmented using  thermal protocol before being mixed and agitated for 30 minutes at 37 . Prior to encapsulation, tagmented cells were kept on ice. Tagmented cells were loaded onto the ddSEQ Single-Cell Isolator (12004336, Bio-Rad). The SureCell ATAC-Seq Library Prep Kit (17004620, Bio-Rad) and SureCell ddSEQ Index Kit (12009360, Bio-Rad) were used to prepare scATAC libraries. Ampure XP beads (A63880, Beckman Coulter) were used to clean up the libraries. Barcoded amplicons were further amplified through  PCR cycles. These PCR products were cleaned up using Ampure XP beads and quality was assessed on both  TapeStation (D5000, Agilent) and Bioanalyzer. Library concentrations were quantified by on  Qubit Fluorometer by Qubit dsDNA HS Kit. Experiments were then pooled and sequenced by Bio-Rad on four lanes of  Novaseq-6000. Malkani et al.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nQUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS miRNA quantification analysis from ddPCR data We previously utilized NASA GeneLab database to make unbiased predictions about miRNAs potentially involved in regulating the spaceflight response (Beheshti et al., 2018). The transcriptomic datasets analyzed in this study include GLDS-25 (livers from female C57BL/6J mice,  = 15 per group), GLDS-21 (gastrocnemius from female C57BL/6J mice,  =  per group), GLDS-63 (mammary gland, liver, and adipose tissue from pregnant female Sprague-Dawley rats,  =  per group), GLDS-111 (soleus and extensor digitorum longus from male C57/BL6 mice,  =  per group), GLDS- (thymus from C57BL/6NTac mice,  =  per group), GLDS-61 (skin from male C57Bl/J10 mice,  =  per group), and GLDS-48 (liver from female C57BL/6J mice,  =  per group). Details for this work and analysis is available in Beheshti et al. (Beheshti et al., 2018) and is the basis of the analysis we are describing in these methods. Experimental groups and the number of replicates () within each group are summarized in Table S1. For analysis on the archived serum from the simulated murine experiments, we grouped all miRNA copies/ng values for NL Sham controls together and all other experimental groups were compared to the NL Sham conditions. For all analysis the  values reported are two-sided and adjusted with the significance indicated by *  value < .05, **  value < .01, and ***  value < .001. Hierarchical clustering of the miRNA values were displayed as heatmaps with pheamap and -Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (-SNE) analysis (van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008) was done to determine how the samples cluster together based on the miRNA values. The miRNA values were also plotted using -program ggplot2 (v3..) (Wickham, 2016.) as scatterplots and data points were then fit using  generalized additive model (GAM) (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1986; Wood et al., 2015). Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway predictions from the miRNAs were determined by the DIANA-TarBase v7. algorithm. Correlation plots between miRNAs and different conditions were plotted using  program corrplot v0.84. Lastly, OriginPro 2015 was used to plot bar plots and of the fold-change values between conditions and also boxplots. In silico predictions of genes from miRNAs Through the use of  Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) plug-in called ClueGo/CluePedia (Bindea et al., 2013), we were able to predict genes targeted by the miRNAs determined. This involved entering all miRNAs in ClueGo and allowing the software to determine the top 50 genes that were significantly regulated and connected to the miRNAs. The predictions only reflect the functions that will be regulated by the miRNAs and do not show whether the function will be activated or inhibited. We also predicted the impact of the miRNAs on overall pathways by utilizing DIANA microT-CDS tool which allows for pathway discovery from targeted miRNAs (Paraskevopoulou et al., 2013; Reczko et al., 2012). Lastly, miRNet . was utilized to predict the diseases that are associated with the miRNAs (Chang et al., 2020). Analysis of miRNA sequencing from murine samples Raw reads were subjected to an in-house software program, ACGT101-miR (LC Sciences, Houston, Texas, USA) to remove adaptor dimers, junk, low complexity, common RNA families (rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA) and repeats. Subsequently, unique sequences with length in 18~26 Malkani et al. Page 23 Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 September 15. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nnucleotide were mapped to specific species precursors in miRBase 22. (Kozomara et al., 2019) by BLAST search to identify known miRNAs and novel 3p- and 5p- derived miRNAs. Length variation at both   and   ends and one mismatch inside of the sequence were allowed in the alignment. The unique sequences mapping to specific species mature miRNAs in hairpin arms were identified as known miRNAs. The unique sequences mapping to the other arm of known specific species precursor hairpin opposite to the annotated mature miRNA-containing arm were considered to be novel 5p- or 3p- derived miRNA candidates. The remaining sequences were mapped to other selected species precursors (with the exclusion of specific species) in miRBase 22. by BLAST search, and the mapped pre-miRNAs were further BLASTed against the specific species genomes to determine their genomic locations. The above two we defined as known miRNAs. The unmapped sequences were BLASTed against the specific genomes, and the hairpin RNA structures containing sequences were predicated from the flank 80 nt sequences using RNAfold software (http:// rna.tbi.univie.ac.at/cgi-bin/RNAWebSuite/RNAfold.cgi). The criteria for secondary structure prediction were: () number of nucleotides in one bulge in stem ( 12); () number of base pairs in the stem region of the predicted hairpin ( 16); () cutoff of free energy (kCal/mol    15); () length of hairpin (up and down stems + terminal loop   50); () length of hairpin loop ( 20); () number of nucleotides in one bulge in mature region ( ); () number of biased errors in one bulge in mature region ( ); () number of biased bulges in mature region ( ); () number of errors in mature region ( ); (10) number of base pairs in the mature region of the predicted hairpin ( 12); and (11) percent of mature in stem ( 80). Differential expression of miRNAs based on normalized deep-sequencing counts was analyzed by selectively using Fisher exact test, Chi-square 2X2 test, Chi-square nXn test, Student  test, or ANOVA based on the experimental design. The significance threshold was set to be .01 and .05 in each test. To determine gene ontology (GO) (Smith and Eppig, 2009) and C2 pathways being regulated by the miRNAs we performed miRNA gene set analysis utilizing the RBiomirGS v0..12  package (Zhang and Storey, 2018) from the processed miRNA analysis for all conditions in the plasma and heart tissues. From the pathways we chose an FDR < .25 cutoff for significantly regulated pathways. We plotted the specific pathways with  packages ggplot2. Analysis of miRNA sequencing from NASA Twin Study samples Standard libraries were preprocessed and quality controlled using miRTrace (Kang et al., 2018). Subsequently, reads were mapped against MirGeneDB sequences (Fromm et al., 2020) using the miRDeep2 (Friedl nder et al., 2012) quantifier module. Expression values were normalized to reads per million (RPM) considering only miRNA counts. The normalized RPM value were utilized for all analysis. If the value for the miRNA was zero for all samples that miRNA was excluded from the analysis. To determine statistically significant miRNAs, ANOVA analysis with  value < . was independently performed for each cell type. For flight only comparisons, the same statistical significance was applied for all time points excluding the ground samples and all ambient return samples. All statistics were run independently for each cell condition/type. To determine the overlap of the miRNA Malkani et al. Page 24 Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 September 15.

Analysis of scRNA and abseq from NASA Twins Study samples Fastq files were uploaded to Seven Bridges Genomics. Data was demultiplexed and sequences analyzed with BD  Rhapsody pipeline (BD Rhapsody Analysis Pipeline . Beta) on Seven Bridges ( Data was then loaded into Seurat (version ..) for analysis (Stuart et al., 2019). This generated  sparse matrix file of features by barcodes. This sparse matrix data was then read into  using the  package Seurat .., and standard quality control was run to remove cells with few genes. Data was then scaled and normalized. MAST (Finak et al., 2015) was used to determine DEGs between all combinations of preflight, return and postflight for both TW and HR samples. Linear dimensional reduction was performed by calculation of PCA from the most variable genes. Cells were then clustered using  resolution value of . and visualized by UMAP. Marker genes were checked for RNA and epitope expression for each cluster and assigned to the indicated cell types, with cell subtypes being grouped to match the scATAC data (Figures S2E and S2F). multiMiR was used to extract target genes for spaceflight-associated miRNA (Ru et al., 2014). Module scores for each spaceflight-associated miRNA target signature was calculated by AddModuleScore with  control value of . Violin plots were created with ggplot2 (version .., (Wickham, 2016.) and significance tested by Wilcoxon rank sum using the geom_signif function. Cells were subsetted by cell type and dot plots were generated using the Seurat DotPlot function. Full list of RNA and AbSeq target genes are found in Table S3. Analysis of scATAC from NASA Twins Study samples Fastq files from each sample were processed individually through BioRad  scATAC processing pipeline according to the Bio-Rad ATAC-seq Analysis Toolkit Tutorial using the Bio-Rad docker images to run FastQC, debarcode, align reads, filter and deconvolute beads, and cell filtration. The aligned reads for each experiment were then processed using SnapTools (version ..) to create 5kb bins and  bin by cell matrix (Fang et al., 2020). The matrices for each sample were combined and then processed using SnapATAC (version ..) using the suggested parameters to filter for high-quality barcodes and remove bins that overlapped with ENCODE hg38 blacklisted regions or ChrM (Fang et al., 2020). Diffusion maps were computed for dimensionality reduction, and significant components were determined. Genes were assigned to each bin based off of GRCh38.p13. The resulting Snap object was then converted to  Seurat object and exported to Seurat (version ..). Samples were scaled and normalized, and anchors were transferred from the 10X PBMC dataset to the experiment from date /30/2019, as it contained the control, non-leukocyte depleted PBMCs. This data was then integrated using the IntegrateData function with the experiment from date /18/2019, and anchors were transferred from the /30/2019 experiment to the integrated object. Cells were assigned cell types based off of the predicted score, with cell subtypes being grouped to match the scRNA and epitope data (Figure S3I). Due to the sparsity of the data, MAGIC (Rmagic ..) was then used to impute activity using the default parameters (van Dijk et al., 2018). The imputed activity was then used to generate dot plots and violin plots, with significance being tested by Wilcoxon rank sum using the geom_signif function. Malkani et al. Page 25 Cell Rep.

Received:  September 2017; Accepted: 30 September 2017; Published: 10 October 2017 Abstract: Space radiation may pose  risk to skeletal health during subsequent aging. Irradiation acutely stimulates bone remodeling in mice, although the long-term in uence of space radiation on bone-forming potential (osteoblastogenesis) and possible adaptive mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation impairs osteoblastogenesis in an ion-type speci  manner, with low doses capable of modulating expression of redox-related genes. 16-weeks old, male, C57BL6/ mice were exposed to low linear-energy-transfer (LET) protons (150 MeV/) or high-LET 56Fe ions (600 MeV/) using either low ( or 10 cGy) or high (50 or 200 cGy) doses at NASA  Space Radiation Lab. Five weeks or one year after irradiation, tissues were harvested and analyzed by microcomputed tomography for cancellous microarchitecture and cortical geometry. Marrow-derived, adherent cells were grown under osteoblastogenic culture conditions. Cell lysates were analyzed by RT-PCR during the proliferative or mineralizing phase of growth, and differentiation was analyzed by imaging mineralized nodules. As expected,  high dose (200 cGy), but not lower doses, of either 56Fe or protons caused  loss of cancellous bone volume/total volume. Marrow cells produced mineralized nodules ex vivo regardless of radiation type or dose; 56Fe (200 cGy) inhibited osteoblastogenesis by more than 90% ( weeks and  year post-IR). After  weeks, irradiation (protons or 56Fe) caused few changes in gene expression levels during osteoblastogenesis, although  high dose 56Fe (200 cGy) increased Catalase and Gadd45. The addition of exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) protected marrow-derived osteoprogenitors from the damaging effects of exposure to low-LET (137Cs  ) when irradiated in vitro, but had limited protective effects on high-LET 56Fe-exposed cells. In sum, either protons or 56Fe at  relatively high dose (200 cGy) caused persistent bone loss, whereas only high-LET 56Fe increased redox-related gene expression, albeit to  limited extent, and inhibited osteoblastogenesis. Doses below 50 cGy did not elicit widespread responses in any parameter measured. We conclude that high-LET irradiation at 200 cGy impaired osteoblastogenesis and regulated steady-state gene expression of select redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis, which may contribute to persistent bone loss.

Introduction Structural degradation and oxidative stress following exposure to space radiation potentially endangers skeletal health of astronauts, both during the mission and later in life. Weightlessness-induced Int. . Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2117; doi:10.3390/ijms18102117 www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2117  of 17 musculoskeletal atrophy, psychological stress, and confinement pose additional risks to astronaut health []. For exploration missions into deep space, galactic cosmic-rays (GCR) are of particular concern because of the high-energy and densely ionizing pattern of energy deposition from heavy ions [ ], which can induce oxidative stress [,] in various tissues. Both solar particle-emissions (SPE) and GCR contribute to the mixed composition of low-energy radiation (such as protons and   rays), high linear-energy-transfer (LET) particles (such as ionized 56Fe- and 12C-nuclei), and secondary constituents, such as Bremmstrahlung, fragmentation products, and neutrons [,]. Estimates of the total absorbed dose during  Mars mission (180-day transits with 500-day surface operations) to be between 28 47 cGy, with GCR contributing 27 cGy [,]. Currently, risk of exposure-induced death from  fatal cancer drives the NASA astronaut career radiation-exposure limit [10], though NASA is investigating additional risks associated with acute and late tissue degeneration following radiation exposure [11]. Irradiation perturbs the redox balance within the bone and marrow compartment in  complex and transient manner. Total-body irradiation (137Cs, 200 cGy) induces rapid reactive oxidative species formation in the marrow [12] and increases expression of the master transcription factor that binds to the antioxidant response element, nuclear factor (erythroid-derived )-like  (Nrf2) [13]. Excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) can interfere with osteogenesis of bone marrow derived osteoprogenitors [14,15] as well as contribute to bone resorption by osteoclasts [16]. High-LET 56Fe ( 200 cGy) impairs cell proliferation during osteoblastogenesis from marrow progenitors in  dose-dependent manner [17]. Further, irradiation in vitro with 56Fe (100 cGy) arrests the cell cycle and inhibits proliferation of mesenchymal stem cells [18]. At higher doses (400 800 cGy), irradiation with -rays increases ROS, depletes antioxidant stores, increases Nrf2 protein levels, and reduces differentiation in osteoblast-like cells [19]. However, the role of oxidative stress on the potential for total-body irradiation (TBI) to impair osteoblastogenesis over the long term, in particular low-dose, high-LET species, has not been fully characterized. We posed three principal questions to address in this study. First, are the severity of acute bone loss [12,13,20,21] and impairment of osteoblastogenesis [17] following TBI dependent on radiation type (LET) or dose? Secondly, which pathways are activated? Finally, do irradiation-induced insults to skeletal structure and osteoblastogenesis persist long after exposure? We hypothesized that: () irradiation induces bone loss, shown previously to be dominated by total dose of exposure [22], and leads to temporal perturbations in antioxidant defenses; () TBI induces both persistent changes in redox-related genes and cancellous microarchitecture in an ion-dependent manner; and, () addition of an antioxidant, here the enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD), mitigates irradiation-induced damage to osteoprogenitors and stem cells when exposed in vitro, implicating an oxidative-stress dependent mechanism. To address these questions, we conducted in vivo and in vitro experiments. For in vivo work, we selected protons and 56Fe ions as representative radiation for the abundant low-LET particles in space radiation and the heavy-ion component of galactic cosmic radiation, respectively. For in vitro work, we selected 137Cs   rays as  low-LET reference radiation to enable high-throughput countermeasure testing. In vivo, there were persistent and profound decrements in mineralized nodules after TBI (at 200 cGy) with 56Fe, while protons had  milder effect. In contrast to our hypothesis, few changes were observed in the steady-state expression of redox-related genes during ex vivo osteoblastogenesis following TBI, although there was some indication of altered expression of select genes during the proliferative phase (at 200 cGy 56Fe, but not lower doses). Furthermore, scavenging ROS with an antioxidant (.., SOD) mitigated adverse effects of in vitro irradiation with   rays, but failed to protect fully from irradiation with an equivalent dose of heavy ions. . Results ..

Tibiae and femora were collected for assessment of the cancellous microarchitecture. Bone-marrow cells were cultured ex vivo in osteoblastogenic media for colony counts and mineralization assays. Additionally, the effects of total body irradiation on gene expression were assayed at two points, during the proliferation and mineralization phase, of osteoblastogenesis.

At  weeks post-irradiation, osteoblastogenic cultures were halted during the proliferative phase and differentiation phase for gene expression assessment; () Experiment to determine the acute effect of proton or 56Fe irradiation on the antioxidant status of the bone marrow extracellular  uid (ECF). Mice were irradiated and euthanized either one or seven days after exposure. Marrow was collected and cells removed through centrifugation. The supernatant, de ned as the extracellular  uid (ECF), was assessed for total antioxidant capacity. .. Body Mass Temporal Responses and Coat Color Body mass was measured ( . ), at least weekly, throughout the study as an index of general health (Figure , showing the -year post irradiation cohorts). As determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Dunnett  posthoc, within six days of exposure, 56Fe (200 cGy) reduced the cohort  mean body mass by % relative to the starting weights. Other doses and ions had no signi cant effect relative to starting weights [23]. Shipment of the mice from Brookhaven National Lab (BNL) to NASA Ames between days  and , caused  % decline in body weights of all of the groups. Following shipment, the body mass of all groups rose over time (+% for the -weeks endpoint and +46% for the -year endpoint), with no treatment effect, nor interaction of time   treatment (Figure ). By the time of euthanasia at -weeks or -year post-irradiation, body mass did not signi cantly differ between irradiated and age-matched sham-controls. Additionally, as an index of general health, the coat color was assessed as grey or black at the end of the experiment (-year post-irradiation). In sham controls,  out of 13 mice had  grey coat (Table ). In contrast, 56Fe (200 cGy) caused all of the 11 to have grey coats. The lower doses of 56Fe irradiation, 10 or 50 cGy, did not modulate coat color compared to sham-controls, respectively. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2117  of 17 Figure .

Ex Vivo Osteoblastogenesis To assess the cellular responses to irradiation during ex vivo osteoblast growth and maturation, we cultured marrow progenitor cells at the  week and  year post-irradiation endpoints. For cultures plated  weeks post-irradiation, gene expression, alkaline phosphatase activity, colony counts, and DNA content analyses were performed during the proliferative phase (seven days after plating) and mineralization phase (19 to 21 days after plating). At the end of the latter phase, the mineralized area was quanti ed to assess the functional outcome of differentiation. During the mineralization phase, we observed well-formed nodules in the sham and proton-irradiated (200 cGy) groups (Figure 4A,), with sham values displaying wide variance. In contrast, we observed very few, yet fully mineralized, nodules in the 56Fe-irradiated (200 cGy) group (Figure 4A,). After quantifying the nodule area, irradiation with 56Fe (200 cGy) tended to cause   91% decrement ( = .06, Figure 4A,) in the mineralization area (median) as compared to sham-irradiated controls. This inhibitory effect is consistent with findings from our other experiments with this dose of 56Fe at various times after exposure [23]. Although, mineralization area of cultures from animals exposed to protons (200 cGy) tended to be lower than sham-controls ( 70%,  = .10, Figure 4A,), nodules from proton-irradiated mice appeared larger and more widespread than in cultures from 56Fe-irradiated mice (Figure 4B). Lower doses of either species did not affect mineralized area or any other measured parameters [23]. Radiation exposure did not modify expression levels for most of the genes analyzed during the mineralization phase (Table ), although  high dose of 56Fe (200 cGy) tended to decrease expression of the osteoblast differentiation gene Alpl by  60% ( = .12), Figure 4C. Additionally,  low dose of 56Fe (10 cGy) increased the expression of the antioxidant gene CuZnSOD (+90%) as compared to sham-controls, whereas proton exposure did not modify expression levels for any of the genes assayed [23].

Total Antioxidant Capacity of the Marrow Extracellular Fluid To assess the changes in the redox microenvironment in the marrow cavity following irradiation, we measured the antioxidant capacity of the extracellular  uid from the marrow, (normalized by protein concentration) at one and seven days after exposure to 56Fe or protons (Figure 1B). Protons (200 cGy) or 56Fe (200 cGy) decreased the total antioxidant capacity of the marrow extracellular  uid by over 35% within one day of exposure (Figure ). In contrast, seven days after exposure, protons caused  62% elevation of antioxidant capacity (Figure ), whereas 56Fe did not differ from sham controls. Lower doses of radiation ( cGy 56Fe or 10 cGy proton), did not modify antioxidant capacity per proton concentration with sham-controls at either timepoint. * * * Sham 56Fe Proton   10 200 200   10 200 200 (cGy) Figure .

In Vitro Radiation Effects on Osteoblastogenesis We hypothesized that  radiation-induced rise in ROS damages osteoprogenitors, leading to  decrease in number and activity of differentiated progeny and therefore exogenous antioxidant is expected to mitigate adverse effects of radiation on the proliferation and subsequent differentiation of osteoprogenitors derived from the marrow. The in uence of  low-LET species (137Cs) was compared to that of high-LET 56Fe. Adherent marrow cells grown under osteoblastogenic culture conditions were irradiated at day  in culture and the percentage change in DNA content between day  (day of irradiation) and day 10 calculated as  surrogate of culture growth (proliferation). Analysis of the dose-response to 137Cs and 56Fe revealed signi cant decrements in growth after exposure to 137Cs (200 cGy and 500 cGy) or 56Fe (100 cGy, 200 cGy), but not after exposure to lower doses (Figure 7A). Colony counts also were affected at the higher doses of radiation [23]. In summary, as shown in Figure 7A, osteoprogenitors appeared more sensitive to high-LET 56Fe than low-LET 137Cs  . To begin to assess the contribution of oxidative stress after in vitro radiation exposure of osteoprogenitors, several antioxidants (including SOD with and without polyethylene glycol (PEG); SOD with nanoparticles or liposomes; Catalase with and without PEG) were screened by addition to the culture media, with SOD (without carrier) showing the most promising results [23]. Addition of exogenous SOD (200 /mL) provided twice  day (on day  and day ) effectively protected cell growth from irradiation with 137Cs, whereas higher doses of SOD or longer periods of treatment were less effective [23]. As shown in Figure 7B, addition of SOD prevented the inhibition of growth by 137Cs (200 cGy). In contrast, addition of SOD was not as suf cient to rescue the cell death incurred after exposure to an equivalent dose of 56Fe (200 cGy). Int. . Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2117  of 17 Figure .

Discussion Heavy-ion irradiation during space missions is  risk to the skeletal health of astronauts, causing skeletal degeneration and cellular damage in simulations with rodents [12,20,24]. In this study, we sought to elucidate the role of radiation type and changes in the oxidative milieu of bone marrow related to marrow-derived osteoprogenitor differentiation. We found that low doses (below 50 cGy) of either low-LET protons or high-LET 56Fe did not cause observable adverse effects on structure and osteoblastogenesis at any endpoint, and, further, did not strongly perturb antioxidant capacity at seven days of exposure (Figure ) nor expression levels of redox-related genes (Figure , Table ) at 35 days of exposure. In contrast, only  high dose of 56Fe radiation (200 cGy) was suf cient to induce detrimental effects on total antioxidant capacity, bone structure, and osteoprogenitor populations of the marrow (Figures  ). These changes were associated with transient elevations in mRNA levels (Figure 4C,) of an antioxidant gene (Catalase) and  DNA-damage/cell cycle arrest marker (Gadd45) during ex vivo osteoblastogenesis, which we speculate indicates persistent oxidative stress or enhanced antioxidant defenses during the proliferative phase. Interestingly, cultures showed  trend towards elevation of osteocalcin (Bglap, Figure 4D),  late marker of differentiation, during the proliferative phase, which may indicate that 56Fe exposure accelerated differentiation. Body mass and coat color were assessed as general indices of animal health. Body mass indicated that animals showed  modest and transient decline in response to 56Fe irradiation with 200 cGy\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci.",

Sci. 2017, 18, 2117 10 of 17 (Figure ), consistent with our previous studies [17]. Additionally, 56Fe irradiation at 200 cGy uniquely caused  shift in coat color from black to grey (Table ). We interpret this as  hallmark of oxidative stress in the hair follicle [25], and, when coupled with the osteoprogenitor effects, this may signal premature aging in  second tissue, in line with the free-radical theory of cellular aging [26,27]. In rodents, radiation injury to bone between with 56Fe (10 200 cGy,  GeV/) [17] manifests as acute cell death of marrow cells and concomitant cancellous bone loss driven by osteoclasts [12,22,28]. In this work, we showed that high-dose 56Fe or proton (200 cGy) caused  transient reduction in antioxidant capacity in the marrow microenvironment (Figure ), potentially indicative of  depletion of extracellular antioxidant stores with subsequent recovery of the extracellular antioxidant defense system [29]. These findings are consistent with our data showing the marrow cell response to increase mRNA expression levels of the master antioxidant transcription factor, Nrf2, shown previously [13], and with effects also evident in  cell line at even higher doses [19]. Our group showed that  dietary supplement rich in antioxidants and polyphenols (dried plum) prevents bone loss and Nrf2 induction from   irradiation in mice [30], supportive of the role of oxidative stress in driving acute bone loss. Additionally, in vitro, 200 cGy 56Fe impairs osteoblastogenesis [17]. Our work extends this high-dose impairment in vivo and to five weeks and one year post-exposure, suggesting an irreversible insult to osteoblastogenesis. Gene expression analyses during the proliferative phase (Figure 4D) revealed that  high dose of 56Fe (200 cGy) increased the expression of genes for the cell cycle arrest marker Gadd45 and antioxidant Catalase relative to sham. These data are consistent with  G2/ arrest from high-LET irradiation of mesenchymal stem cells [18],  pre-osteoblast cell line [31], and many other cell types [32]. Interestingly, these two genes are targets of Foxo transcription factors [33 35]. Nrf2, Foxos, and p21 are critical to the antioxidant response element [36]. Oxidative stress activates Foxo transcription factors [37] and interferes with Wnt signaling [14,38 40]. Hence, our data suggest Foxo activation may play  role in 56Fe irradiation, decreasing osteoprogenitor cell proliferation, and, ultimately, mineralization levels. During the mineralization phase (Figure 4A,), 56Fe irradiation (200 cGy) tended to reduce nodule formation and alkaline phosphatase gene expression, suggesting  reduction in early markers of early-stage osteoblast differentiation and fewer cells contributing to nodule formation, consistent with in vitro evidence for high-dose effects [19]. Taken together with gene expression data, these  ndings suggest that irradiation induced persistent oxidative stress that impaired colony formation via reduced proliferation (.., delayed or halted cell division) leading to lower extent of mineralization. Higher doses of   irradiation (>500 cGy) are required to recapitulate the impairment of osteoblastogenesis [41,42], where changes are also associated with oxidative damage [43]. Taking these  ndings into consideration, the sequelae of  high-dose of heavy-ion irradiation are likely impaired osteoblastogenesis, which may be attributable to persistent oxidative stress. For evaluating structural responses, we analyzed cancellous regions in the tibia (Figure ) and the cortical midshaft of the femur (Table ) at two time points for parameters indicative of structural integrity. At -weeks after irradiation, exposure to high-LET 56Fe irradiation at or above 50 cGy caused decrements in fractional bone volume and trabecular number, and increases in trabecular spacing (Figure ), indicating  signi cant deterioration of cancellous microarchitecture, consistent with previous  ndings [20,22,44]. The magnitude of the changes caused by protons or 56Fe were similar, although the effect of protons at 50 cGy on BV/TV was not statistically signi cant ( = .12). Thus, these  ndings indicate that the threshold for  persistent, 56Fe radiation-induced response lies between 10 and 50 cGy doses relevant to exploration missions [11]. Overall, we show that  high dose of radiation was able to induce persistent decrements in cancellous bone, regardless of radiation type (Figure ). Others have shown that these changes persist to four months post-exposure [22]. In this study, the structural decrement affected by 56Fe (200 cGy) was resolved one year after exposure due to the expected age-related decline in sham-control animals changes over time (Table ), likely the product of age-induced elevations of osteoclasts overtaking waning bone formation by osteoblasts [45]. These data are consistent with our previous  ndings from growing female mice after exposure to low-LET   radiation [46].

Sci. 2017, 18, 2117 11 of 17 either low-LET   at high doses (500 cGy) [47] or high-LET 56Fe at 50 cGy [48], no irradiation-induced cortical responses at -year post exposure were evident in this study [23], or in other experiments we have performed in the past. Thus, the in uence of ionizing radiation at 200 cGy or below appears to be restricted to the more metabolically-active cancellous tissue. In vitro irradiation studies were conducted to further assess the role of oxidative stress in radiation damage to osteoprogenitors. Our approach was to test antioxidants and their capacity to rescue radiation effects to provide insight into the different mechanisms between low-LET radiation and high-LET radiation [31]. Although similar doses of low-LET radiation are generally less deleterious than high-LET radiation, the mechanisms for radiation damage to primary, marrow-derived osteoprogenitors in the context of oxidative stress are not fully elucidated [49 51]. When comparing the effects of low-LET radiation (137Cs) and high-LET radiation (56Fe), we found high-LET irradiation was more damaging with respect to growth of the cell population, as assessed by  surrogate assay (changes in DNA content over time). Furthermore, exogenous SOD effectively protected osteoprogenitors from low-LET radiation damage, but only minimally from 56Fe at 100 cGy, and not at all from 56Fe at 200 cGy. Taken together, these  ndings indicate excess extracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) inhibited growth, and that oxidative stress is possibly the main mechanism involved in low-LET radiodamage to osteoprogenitors; in contrast, high-LET species likely affect the cells via additional detrimental mechanisms, such as double-strand DNA breaks. Although others [52,53] have shown the bene cial effects of various antioxidants to confer radioprotection for various osteoblast cell lines, we show here  direct comparison of antioxidant treatment with different radiation species when added to primary, marrow-derived osteoprogenitors. Interestingly, adding SOD at higher doses or for longer periods was not advantageous, emphasizing the importance of carefully titrating radical scavengers such as SOD, possibly to maintain endogenous ROS-dependent signalling. In sum, we showed the ability of the antioxidant superoxide dismutase (SOD) to mitigate the adverse effects of in vitro irradiation with   rays (used for the low-LET radiation), but not to an equivalent dose of high-LET 56Fe. Our results strengthen the potential application of SOD as  countermeasure for low-LET irradiation-induced damage to marrow stem cells and osteoprogenitors. Inherent limitations of these experiments with respect to radiation exposures include: () exposures were delivered at high dose-rate and fluence in  matter of minutes, whereas in space, the same dose is delivered at  lower rate, and () space exposures are mixed doses, rather than  single species (.., SPE can deliver 100 200 cGy over days and GCR over years). In addition, with respect to relevance to spaceflight, these experiments were performed in mice that were normally ambulatory, thus not subjected to musculoskeletal disuse and fluid shifts, which are induced by microgravity; groundbased models for spaceflight have shown that unloading can influence radiosensitivity [17,24,54,55]. In summary, our  ndings indicate that although low doses of radiation do not show lasting effects on skeletal health,  high dose of high-LET 56Fe impairs osteoblast growth and maturation by adversely affecting growth of osteoprogenitors. There were few, select changes in steady-state expression of redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis ex vivo after total body irradiation with 56Fe (but not protons), with some indication of altered expression of select genes during the proliferative phase. Furthermore, scavenging ROS with antioxidants, such as SOD, mitigated the adverse effects of in vitro irradiation with   rays (200 cGy), but failed to protect from irradiation with an equivalent dose of heavy ions. Together, our  ndings indicate that high-dose radiation has  persistent effect to impair bone formation by adversely affecting growth, but not differentiation, of osteoprogenitors. . Materials and Methods .. Animals Male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratories, Bar Harbor, ME, USA) were individually housed under standard conditions and provided food (LabDiet 5001, Purina, St. Louis, MO, USA) and water\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2117 12 of 17 ad libitum as described by [13]. As  general measure of animal health, we measured body mass weekly for the duration of the study. Additionally, we blindly scored coat color as black or grey at the one-year post-irradiation endpoint. Animals were euthanized by cardiac puncture while under iso urane overdose followed by cervical dislocation. The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees for NASA Ames Research Center (Protocol NAS-10-001-Y2, 17 February 2011) and Brookhaven National Laboratory (Protocol #431,  February 2011) approved all of the procedures. .. In Vivo Experiment Design and Radiation Exposure Two experiments using mice were conducted to assess the effect of radiation type on skeletal antioxidant response, osteoblastogenesis, and bone structure. In the first experiment (Figure 1A), conscious 16-weeks old, male, C57BL6/ mice were exposed to low-LET protons (150 MeV/, LET ~.52 keV/ ) or high-LET 56Fe ions (600 MeV/, LET ~175 keV/ ) at , 10, 50, or 200 cGy at NASA  Space Radiation Lab at Brookhaven National Lab (Upton, NY, USA). Between   days after irradiation, mice were shipped overnight from Brookhaven to NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA. Select groups of mice were euthanized and tissues harvested after 35 38 days for 56Fe, 36 39 days for proton, or 36 38 days for the sham (these three groups are deemed  weeks post-irradiation and had  =  per group) and late (358 or 360 days, here deemed  year post-irradiation and had  = 13 per group) for ex vivo osteoprogenitor culture of marrow cells. Tibiae or femora were collected for cancellous microarchitecture assessment with microcomputed tomography. For the -week endpoint, osteoblast cultures ( =   mice/group) were analyzed by real-time qPCR ( =  mice/group, see below for details), total DNA quantification, and alkaline phosphatase activity during the proliferative phase (seven days after plating) or the mineralization phase (19 21 days after plating) stages of osteoblast differentiation. At the termination of cultures, mineralized nodules were imaged and analyzed for percent surface area at the end of the culture period. For the -year endpoint, osteoblast cultures ( = /group) were analyzed for colony number during the proliferative phase (eight days after plating) or for mineralized nodule area during the mineralization phase (28 days after plating) of osteoblast differentiation. In the second experiment (Figure 1B), we aimed to determine the effects of total-body irradiation on the antioxidant capacity of the extracellular  uid surrounding the marrow cells [56].",

Irradiation acutely stimulates bone remodeling in mice, although the long-term influence of space radiation on bone-forming potential (osteoblastogenesis) and possible adaptive mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation impairs osteoblastogenesis in an ion-type specific manner, with low doses capable of modulating expression of redox-related genes. 16-weeks old, male, C57BL6/J mice were exposed to low linear-energy-transfer (LET) protons (150 MeV/n) or high-LET 56Fe ions (600 MeV/n) using either low (5 or 10 cGy) or high (50 or 200 cGy) doses at NASA’s Space Radiation Lab. Five weeks or one year after irradiation, tissues were harvested and analyzed by microcomputed tomography for cancellous microarchitecture and cortical geometry. Marrow-derived, adherent cells were grown under osteoblastogenic culture conditions. Cell lysates were analyzed by RT-PCR during the proliferative or mineralizing phase of growth, and differentiation was analyzed by imaging mineralized nodules. As expected, a high dose (200 cGy), but not lower doses, of either 56Fe or protons caused a loss of cancellous bone volume/total volume. Marrow cells produced mineralized nodules ex vivo regardless of radiation type or dose; 56Fe (200 cGy) inhibited osteoblastogenesis by more than 90% (5 weeks and 1 year post-IR). After 5 weeks, irradiation (protons or 56Fe) caused few changes in gene expression levels during osteoblastogenesis, although a high dose 56Fe (200 cGy) increased Catalase and Gadd45. The addition of exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) protected marrow-derived osteoprogenitors from the damaging effects of exposure to low-LET (137Cs ) when irradiated in vitro, but had limited protective effects on high-LET 56Fe-exposed cells. In sum, either protons or 56Fe at a relatively high dose (200 cGy) caused persistent bone loss, whereas only high-LET 56Fe increased redox-related gene expression, albeit to a limited extent, and inhibited osteoblastogenesis. Doses below 50 cGy did not elicit widespread responses in any parameter measured. We conclude that high-LET irradiation at 200 cGy impaired osteoblastogenesis and regulated steady-state gene expression of select redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis, which may contribute to persistent bone loss.",

In the second experiment (Figure 1B), we aimed to determine the effects of total-body irradiation on the antioxidant capacity of the extracellular  uid surrounding the marrow cells [56]. To evaluate ion effects, conscious 16-wk old, male, C57BL6/ mice mice were exposed to 10 or 200 cGy of low-LET protons ( =   per group) or  or 200 cGy of high-LET 56Fe ions ( =  per group) as described above, or were sham irradiated ( = 13 per group). Mice were euthanized and tissues harvested at one or seven days after exposure, at which point tibial marrow was processed for extracellular  uid collection and quanti cation of total antioxidant capacity, described in more detail below. .. In Vitro Experiment Design and Radiation Exposure Osteoprogenitors were grown in vitro from the bone marrow of 16-week old, male C57Bl/ mice, as previously described [17]. Cells were irradiated three days after plating (day ) with either   (137Cs, sham or 10 500 cGy, JL Shepherd Mark ) or 56Fe (sham or 50 200 cGy, NSRL), and then grown until day 10. Cell behavior was assessed by measuring changes in DNA content between day three and day 10 (as  surrogate for cell growth) with the Cyquant assay as previously described [17]. For the SOD experiment, multiple doses were tested in preliminary experiments (100 600 /mL of SOD or vehicle, for  or  days of treatment at different times). The protocol selected for more extensive dose-response experiments entailed the addition of SOD (200 /mL), or vehicle ( -MEM)   before irradiation (day ), twice  day, through the 4th day after exposure to radiation. Experiments were repeated   times. Data were normalized to the sham-control. .. Total Antioxidant Capacity We measured the antioxidant capacity of the extracellular  uid of the marrow (.., the marrow plasma) with  colorimetric assay based on the reduction potential of Cu2+ to Cu1+ as compared to Trolox equivalent standards (Oxford Biomedical, Oxford, MI, USA). In brief, we isolated marrow\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2017, 18, 2117 13 of 17 ex vivo, using 150   of sterile saline to  ush the marrow from the tibial diaphysis, as described previously [56]. The solution was centrifuged and supernatant preserved as the extracellular  uid at  80   for further assessment. The BCA assay assessed the protein concentration of the extracellular  uid against albumin standards, which enabled the normalization of the antioxidant capacity by the protein concentration to account for changes in protein levels with treatment [56]. .. Bone Microarchitecture and Geometry We assessed the bone volume and microarchitecture of the cancellous tissue in the proximal tibial metaphysis using microcomputed tomography (. pixel size, 3500 ms integration time, 50 kV, Skyscan 1174; Bruker microCT, Kontich, Belgium) as described in [13]. For cancellous quanti cation,  .-mm thick region located .24 mm distal to the proximal growth plate was semi-autonomously contoured to include cancellous tissue. We assessed changes in cancellous bone using the three-dimensional bone volume to total volume fraction (BV/TV, %), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), trabecular number (Tb., /mm), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th, mm), and trabecular separation (Tb.Sp, mm). We assessed the changes in cortical bone at the midshaft of the femur using bone volume and cortical thickness. All analyses follow conventional guidelines [57]. .. Ex Vivo Osteoblastogenic Assays and qRT-PCR Analyses For osteoblastogenic culture, femur marrow was  ushed using saline and treated with lysis buffer speci  for red blood cells (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), centrifuged for ten minutes at 1000  , and supernatant removed. Cells were then re-suspended and plated at . 105 cells/cm2 in -well plates. Osteoblastogenic growth medium (alpha minimum essential medium with 15% FBS (Gibco, Gaithersburg, MD, USA),   anti-biotic/mycotic, 50  /mL ascorbic acid, 10 mM  -glycerophosphate) was replenished every   days. For qPCR analyses ( = /group), cells were collected in  solution of %  -mercapthoethanol in RLT Buffer (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) and stored at  80   until RNA isolation via RNeasy minikit (Qiagen). RNA quantity and purity was measured using  nanodrop spectrophotometer (Nanodrop 2000, Thermoscienti , Waltham, MA, USA) while RNA quality was assessed using  .% non-denaturing gel. RT2PCR custom array (PAMM-999A-, SYBR probes, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was processed with an Applied Biosystems 7500 cycler to generate gene expression data. The  Ct method was used to analyze the raw data. Cycle values above 35 were de ned as non-detectable. Statistical analyses were performed on log2-transformed data. Fifteen representative genes were analyzed to assess osteoblast differentiation, proliferation, oxidative metabolism, or apoptosis, see Table . All genes were normalized to housekeeping gene Hprt. Technical issues forced the loss of one specimen from the 56Fe, 200 cGy group during the proliferative phase and the loss of all four specimens in the proton, 10 cGy group from mineralization phase.

Colony counts early in culture assessed the successful adherence and proliferation of colony forming units. Parameters de ning  colony included having distinct region of radial colony growth and having more than 30 cells with  majority of cells having of morphological homogeneity. To quantify densely mineralizing area (.., the nodule area), we harvested cultures in the differentiation phase. First, we washed cultures with saline and scanned the plates at 300 dpi resolution. We quanti ed the percentage of well area having mineralizing nodules with Image , using  custom algorithm to threshold the grayscale image. .. Statistics We report parametric data with mean and standard deviation (SD). For these data, to determine signi cant differences,  -way analysis of variance was used followed by Dunnett  post-hoc test, which allowed for the comparison of respective radiation types and doses to the age-matched sham control ( cGy). For non-parametric data (.., nodule area data, as values near zero display skew), we report the median with interquartile range. For these data, to determine signi cant differences, we used  Kruskal-Wallis test with  Steel post-hoc test, which allowed for the comparison of respective radiation types and doses to the age-matched, sham control ( cGy). We assessed temporal (within subjects) treatment (between subjects) effects in body mass, and their interaction (.., time   treatment), using Repeated Measures ANOVA and Wilks  Lamda test. Throughout,  -value  .05 was accepted as signi cant. We performed all analyses using JMP 13 (SAS).

      "subject": "Space radiation may pose a risk to skeletal health during subsequent aging. Irradiation acutely stimulates bone remodeling in mice, although the long-term influence of space radiation on bone-forming potential (osteoblastogenesis) and possible adaptive mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that ionizing radiation impairs osteoblastogenesis in an ion-type specific manner, with low doses capable of modulating expression of redox-related genes. 16-weeks old, male, C57BL6/J mice were exposed to low linear-energy-transfer (LET) protons (150 MeV/n) or high-LET 56Fe ions (600 MeV/n) using either low (5 or 10 cGy) or high (50 or 200 cGy) doses at NASA’s Space Radiation Lab. Five weeks or one year after irradiation, tissues were harvested and analyzed by microcomputed tomography for cancellous microarchitecture and cortical geometry. Marrow-derived, adherent cells were grown under osteoblastogenic culture conditions. Cell lysates were analyzed by RT-PCR during the proliferative or mineralizing phase of growth, and differentiation was analyzed by imaging mineralized nodules. As expected, a high dose (200 cGy), but not lower doses, of either 56Fe or protons caused a loss of cancellous bone volume/total volume. Marrow cells produced mineralized nodules ex vivo regardless of radiation type or dose; 56Fe (200 cGy) inhibited osteoblastogenesis by more than 90% (5 weeks and 1 year post-IR). After 5 weeks, irradiation (protons or 56Fe) caused few changes in gene expression levels during osteoblastogenesis, although a high dose 56Fe (200 cGy) increased Catalase and Gadd45. The addition of exogenous superoxide dismutase (SOD) protected marrow-derived osteoprogenitors from the damaging effects of exposure to low-LET (137Cs ) when irradiated in vitro, but had limited protective effects on high-LET 56Fe-exposed cells. In sum, either protons or 56Fe at a relatively high dose (200 cGy) caused persistent bone loss, whereas only high-LET 56Fe increased redox-related gene expression, albeit to a limited extent, and inhibited osteoblastogenesis. Doses below 50 cGy did not elicit widespread responses in any parameter measured. We conclude that high-LET irradiation at 200 cGy impaired osteoblastogenesis and regulated steady-state gene expression of select redox-related genes during osteoblastogenesis, which may contribute to persistent bone loss.",

While irradiation-induced embrittlement has been attributed to changes in the collagen molecular structure, the relative role of collagen fragmentation versus non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking remains unclear. To better understand the effects of radiation on the bone material without cellular activity, we conducted an ex vivo -ray radiation experiment on excised mouse lumbar vertebrae. Spinal tissue from twenty-week old, female, C57BL/6J mice were randomly assigned to  single -ray radiation dose of either  (control), 50, ,000, 17,000, or 35,000 Gy. Measurements were made for collagen fragmentation, non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking, and both monotonic and cyclic-loading compressive mechanical properties. We found that the group differences for mechanical properties were more consistent with those for collagen fragmentation than for non- enzymatic collagen crosslinking. Monotonic strength at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy was lower than that of the control by 50% and 73% respectively, ( < .001) but at 50 and ,000 Gy was not different than the control. Consistent with those trends, collagen fragmentation only occurred at 17,000 and Corresponding author: Tony .

All results were consistent both for monotonic and cyclic loading conditions. We conclude that the reductions in bone compressive monotonic strength and fatigue life due to ex vivo ionizing radiation are more likely caused by fragmentation of the collagen backbone than any increases in non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks. Keywords ionizing radiation; bone strength; fatigue; collagen; sterilization; bone-graft  Introduction For  variety of clinical applications, bones are exposed to  wide range of ionizing radiation doses. In vivo, radiotherapy treatment results in an accumulated localized dose of ~50 Gy1 in cancer patients [ ]. Ex vivo, bone allografts are sterilized at  dose of 30,000   ,000 Gy [,]. While these high-dose applications are critical for overall patient health and safety, high levels of ionizing radiation exposure have been shown to increase risk of fracture [,]. For example, for women with anal, rectal or colon cancer, those treated with radiation therapy were more than three times as likely to suffer  pelvic fracture than those without radiation therapy []. Furthermore, for patients with implanted bone allografts, allografts sterilized with radiation were twice as likely to fail compared to allografts sterilized using other methods []. The increased risk of fracture clinically has led to research into the effect of high levels of ionizing radiation exposure on the mechanical and biochemical properties of bone. Numerous ex vivo studies on either cortical or cancellous bone have demonstrated that ionizing radiation degrades mechanical properties and collagen molecular structure independent of cellular activity. The demonstrated reduction in post-yield properties   ultimate strain, ultimate strength, fracture toughness, work-to-failure   of irradiated bone [10 15] has been attributed to changes in collagen molecular structure [16 18]. Though the exact mechanism dominating irradiation-induced collagen degradation is not fully known, two mechanisms have been suggested as causes for diminished mechanics [10,12 14,19  23]. First, the collagen backbone can be fragmented when the molecular bonds are cleaved directly by - and gamma-rays, breaking the intact protein chain into smaller polypeptides. Second, collagen molecules can be non-enzymatically crosslinked when radiolysis of water molecules creates free radicals, which cause inter- and intra- molecular bonds within collagen chains. However, it remains unclear which mechanism is more causative and at what dose these mechanisms manifest. Because changes in collagen structure are associated with  number of clinical conditions, an improved biomechanical understanding of each mechanism (.. non-enzymatic crosslinks and fragmentation) may provide insight into applications of irradiation [22], and also aging [24] and diabetes [25 28]. 1Abbreviations: Gy, Gray; Nf, Fatigue Life;  , Strain-to-Failure; Kelastic, Elastic Stiffness; AGEs, Advanced Glycation End Products; FU, Fluorescence Unit; Pendleton et al.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nAddressing these issues, we conducted an ex vivo ionizing radiation experiment on mouse vertebrae spanning  range of clinically-related radiation doses (.. radiation therapy to allograft sterilization) and conducted  suite of mechanical and biochemical assays to assess radiation-induced changes. Specifically, our objectives were to: ) quantify the effects of radiation dose on the monotonic strength and fatigue life of murine vertebrae; and ) determine whether the degradation in mechanical properties is dominated by the amount of non-enzymatic crosslinks or fragmented collagen. Materials and Methods . Animals Forty-eight female, 20-week old (skeletally-mature) C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Labs, Sacramento, CA) were randomly assigned to five groups ( =  10 per group). Mice were euthanized prior to ex vivo irradiation. All procedures were approved by the University of California Berkeley Animal Care and Use Committee. . Specimen preparation Lumbar vertebrae (L3, L4, L5, S1) were excised and gently cleaned of soft tissue, wrapped in saline-soaked gauze (Gibco PBS 1X, pH .), and stored at  20 . In preparation for mechanical testing, the vertebral bodies of the L4 and L5 levels were isolated, endplates precisely planed using  diamond microtome (Leica SP1600 Saw Microtome, Wetzlar, Germany) and posterior elements removed [29]. . Ex Vivo -Ray Irradiation After specimen preparation, ex vivo irradiation was performed on all vertebrae. Mice were randomly assigned to one of five dose groups for -ray irradiation: , 50, ,000, 17,000, or 35,000 Gy; all vertebral levels from the same animal remained in the same radiation dose group (.. an animal assigned to the 50 Gy group had its L3, L4, L5, and S1 irradiated with 50 Gy). Irradiation was performed (Advanced Light Source synchrotron facility at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory) using an -ray synchrotron micro-tomography beam line, at 21 keV and 500 mA, for  dose rate of 13. Gy/sec (see [30] for details on dose calculations). Specimen hydration was maintained during irradiation via saline-soaked gauze. . Quantitative micro-CT Imaging After irradiation, the L4 and L5 specimens were imaged with quantitative micro-CT ( CT 50, Scanco Medical AG, Bruttisellen, Switzerland) using  10-  voxel size (55 kV, 109  , 1000 projections per 180 , 500 ms integration time). Micro-CT images of the L4 and L5 specimens were analyzed for height (ImageJ ., Java ..). The total bone volume of the vertebrae was measured on the L5 only (ImageJ ., BoneJ2). After manual segmentation of the trabecular compartment, the following parameters were measured between the top and bottom surface of the L5 vertebra: trabecular bone volume fraction (Tb.BV/TV), number (Tb.), thickness (Tb.Th), and separation (Tb.Sp) (Scanco Medical  CT Evaluation Program v6.) [29]. The micro-CT analysis confirmed successful random sample distribution; there were no significant differences in bone quantity or microarchitecture between the groups. Pendleton et al.

Mechanical Characterization After micro-CT imaging, uniaxial compressive monotonic (L4) and cyclic (L5) mechanical testing was performed (TA ElectroForce 3200, Eden Prairie, MN; 25 mm linear encoder, measured error   ). Monotonic testing was conducted (displacement rate of .01 mm/sec; strain rate ranged from . to .% strain/) to provide measurements of stiffness, strength (maximum force), ultimate strain (displacement measured by the linear encoder at maximum force divided by specimen height determined via micro-CT) [31], and work-to-fracture (Figure 1A). Cyclic testing was conducted using methods described in detail by Pendleton et al. [29]. In brief, in order to compare the fatigue life across all radiation dose groups, the fatigue test was designed such that the same initial strains were applied to all samples [29]. Using micro-CT based finite element models of each specimen, we computationally derived the specimen-specific forces (Fmin and Fmax) required to achieve the desired initial strains ( min = .05% and  max = .%) during cyclic testing. Thus, specimens were cyclically loaded in uniaxial compression between the specimen-specific Fmin and Fmax values until failure (TA ElectroForce 3200, Eden Prairie, MN; 50 lb. load cell, resolution  . ). Cyclic loading properties measured include fatigue life (Nf) (.. number of cycles to failure), strain-to- failure ( ), and specimen elastic stiffness (Kelastic) (Figure 1B). Cyclic testing was not performed for specimens where the calculated Fmax exceeded the dose group strength observed from monotonic testing, as these specimens would have failed within one loading cycle (confirmed by testing  small sample; data not shown). . Biochemical Characterization After irradiation, two biochemical tests ( =  specimens for each test) were conducted to assess the two primary molecular mechanisms that are thought to alter bone mechanics: () the accumulation of non-enzymatic crosslinks was measured on the S1 vertebrae; () the fragmentation of the collagen backbone was quantified on the L3 vertebrae. To assess non-enzymatic collagen crosslinking, we quantified the relative amount of fluorescent advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) on the S1 vertebrae. AGEs, which form intra- and inter-fibrillar crosslinks along the collagen backbone through oxidation or glycation processes [26,32 34], were quantified using  fluorometric assay (protocol adapted from Sell et al. [35]). Each S1 specimen was demineralized in . ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and hydrolyzed in 12N HCl at 120  for  hours to break down peptide bonds. The hydrolysate was then resuspended in PBS (.1X) and pipetted in triplicate onto  black-walled 96 well plate. The non-enzymatic collagen crosslink content was determined using fluorescence readings taken using  microplate reader at wavelengths of 370 nm excitation and 440 nm emission. The readings were standardized to  quinine-sulfate standard (quinine dissolved in H2SO4) and then normalized to the amount of collagen present in each sample, approximated by the amount of hydroxyproline [13,36]. The quantification of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks was achieved via the fluorometric assay that determined the relative fluorescence due to advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) relative to the amount of collagen in the bone Pendleton et al.

The relative amount of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks (fluorescent AGEs) for each radiation group was compared to the control. To assess collagen fragmentation, we used an automated electrophoresis assay (2100 Bioanalyzer, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) to quantify the molecular weight distribution of collagen isolated from the L3 vertebrae. First, we isolated the collagen via methods adapted from Burton et al. [10] (see [30] for details). In brief, L3 specimens were demineralized over  weeks in .5M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) with the solution changed every   days.",

    "text": "The non-enzymatic collagen crosslink content was determined using fluorescence readings taken using  microplate reader at wavelengths of 370 nm excitation and 440 nm emission. The readings were standardized to  quinine-sulfate standard (quinine dissolved in H2SO4) and then normalized to the amount of collagen present in each sample, approximated by the amount of hydroxyproline [13,36]. The quantification of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks was achieved via the fluorometric assay that determined the relative fluorescence due to advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) relative to the amount of collagen in the bone Pendleton et al.

The relative amount of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks (fluorescent AGEs) for each radiation group was compared to the control. To assess collagen fragmentation, we used an automated electrophoresis assay (2100 Bioanalyzer, Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) to quantify the molecular weight distribution of collagen isolated from the L3 vertebrae. First, we isolated the collagen via methods adapted from Burton et al. [10] (see [30] for details). In brief, L3 specimens were demineralized over  weeks in .5M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) with the solution changed every   days. Demineralized specimens were defatted for 24-hours in  : solution of chloroform and methanol and then soaked in 100% methanol for another hour. Specimens were dried in  desiccator overnight, and then flash-frozen with liquid- nitrogen and crushed into bone powder using  mortar and pestle. Bone powder was then lyophilized (Sequence:  38  for 180 minutes,  38  at 120 mTorr for 90 minutes,  20  at 770 mTorr for 900 minutes,  10   at 930 mTorr for 270 minutes, and 23  at 120 mTorr for 55 minutes) (VirTis AdVantage Plus Benchtop Freeze Dryer XL Model, SP Scientific, Stone Ridge, NY). For tissue digestion, the powder was added to  solution of .5M acetic acid and pepsin (1mg of pepsin per 10 mg of bone powder) and placed on  rocker at   for 72-hours. To neutralize the digestion process 5M NaOH was added until pH was neutral (pH =  ). To remove non-soluble collagen and non-collagenous proteins, samples were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 13,000 RPM. The supernatant, containing the soluble collagen, was collected. To precipitate the collagen out of solution, solid NaCl was added to  final concentration of 2M NaCl and placed on  rocker at   for 24-hours. Samples were centrifuged for 30 minutes at 13,000 RPM. The supernatant was removed, and the pellets were resuspended in 200 uL of .5M acetic acid. Samples were then lyophilized and stored at  20  until electrophoresis. In preparation for electrophoresis, the isolated collagen was dissolved in 1X PBS, mixed with additional reagents (Agilent Technologies Protein 230 Manual), and loaded on  bioanalyzer chip for automated electrophoresis. Rat-tail collagen (Sigma Aldrich, C7661 25MG) was run as  standard. From this assay, the distribution of molecular weights of the collagen protein was assessed in two ways: () visually with  software-generated  gel  and () quantitatively with  software-generated fluorescence unit (FU) chart, called an  electropherogram  (Agilent 2100 Expert software). The nominal size of  type- collagen, either alpha- or alpha-, is between 130 150 kDa. To identify chain fragmentation, we looked for evidence of less protein in this range, and  wider distribution of molecular weights. On the gel, this was observed as  lighter-colored band or smeared band at ~150 kDa. On the electropherogram, fragmentation can be observed when the peak at ~150 kDa is diminished, indicating fewer fluorescence units and therefore fewer collagen chains of the nominal size. The quantification of collagen fragmentation was achieved via the software-generated electropherogram by comparing the quantity of fluorescence units (FU) at the nominal collagen chain length (~150 kDa) for each radiation group to the control. . Statistics We used  one-way ANOVA to test for radiation effects, followed by Dunnett  post-hoc test (at    .05) to compare each group against the control ( Gy) (JMP  14., SAS Institute). For those measurements that were not normally distributed (ultimate strain),  Kruskal- Pendleton et al. Page  Bone. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 November 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nWallis test was conducted instead, followed by the Steel post-hoc to compare each group against the control (JMP  14., SAS Institute). In order to compare the magnitude of responses across the different measurements   vertebral strength, crosslink AGEs, and fragmentation fluorescence   each datum for the individual specimen was normalized by the mean value of that measurement for the control group. Then, the means of these normalized values for the crosslink AGEs and fragmentation fluorescence measurements were individually compared against the mean normalized value for vertebral strength, using  Student  -test (   .05) (JMP  14., SAS Institute). Results . Mechanical Characterization For monotonic compression testing, the vertebral strength, ultimate strain, and work-to- fracture were lower than the control group for radiation exposures of 17,000 and 35,000 Gy but were not different than the control group for exposures of 50 and ,000 Gy. Compared to the control group, for the exposures of 17,000 and 35,000 Gy, vertebral strength was 50% and 73% lower ( < .001, Figure ), respectively, ultimate strain was 58% and 77% lower (Steel post-hoc  < .05, Figure ), and work-to-fracture was 76% and 92% lower ( < .01, data not shown). In contrast, monotonic stiffness remained unchanged for all radiation dose groups compared to the control group (691. 179. /mm;  = .67, Figure ). Similar trends, but more accentuated, were observed for the cyclic properties. Monotonic strength of 17,000 and 35,000 Gy groups were less than the prescribed cyclic loading force, Fmax, and thus cyclic testing was not conducted for these two groups since the specimens would have fractured after one cycle of loading (confirmed by testing  small sample, data not shown). Fatigue life (. . log(cycles);  = .50, Figure ), strain to failure (. . %;  = .41, data not shown), and elastic stiffness (1273   162 /mm;  = .31, data not shown) for the 50 and ,000 Gy exposures did not differ from the control. . Biochemical Characterization The relative amount of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks (fluorescent AGEs) was greater for all radiation groups by nearly twofold, and increased in  dose-dependent manner: by 67%, 95%, 96%, and 108% for 50, ,000, 17,000 and 35,000 Gy, respectively, compared to the control (42. . ng quinine / mg collagen;  < .001, Figure ). In contrast, collagen fragmentation was only observed at doses of 17,000 and 35,000 Gy (Figure ). Fragmentation at these doses was observed on both the software-generated gel (Figure 3A) and electropherogram (Figure 3B). On the gel,  dark band was visible at the nominal collagen chain length of 150 kDa for samples of , 50, and ,000 Gy. This band began to lighten at 17,000 and 35,000 Gy, indicating fewer collagen proteins of this chain size. Also,   smearing  of bands was observed below 150 kDa, suggesting that there was  greater amount of collagen fragmented chains with lower molecular weights. On the electropherogram, the same result can be observed. The peak fluorescence unit found at 150 kDa for 17,000 Gy decreased by 74% compared to the control (460   72 FU;  < .02). Pendleton et al.

By contrast, the normalized values for the unfragmented collagen chains were not different than for vertebral strength ( > .55), except at the 17,000 Gy dose, for which the difference was significant ( = .03) but small (vertebral strength .50   .06; fragmentation .26   .03) (Figure ). . Quantitative micro-CT Imaging The micro-CT analysis confirmed successful random sample distribution; there were no significant differences in bone quantity or microarchitecture between the groups. Total bone volume (.41   .16 mm3,  = .71, data not shown), as well as trabecular bone volume fraction (18.79   .94 %,  = .20, Figure ), number (.92   .13 /mm,  = .35, data not shown), and separation (256.97   .81  ,  = .47, data not shown) were the same for all groups. ANOVA results for trabecular thickness were significant ( = .036), however  Tukey post-hoc analysis found no differences between any groups (50.17   68  ,  > .05, data not shown). Discussion These results demonstrate that the monotonic strength of murine vertebral bodies was only diminished when exposed to ionizing radiation at or above 17,000 Gy. While the relative amount of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks was greater for all radiation groups compared to the control, the increase in crosslinks measured at lower doses (50 and ,000 Gy) did not coincide with the observed reduction in mechanical strength (Figure ). In contrast to crosslinks, collagen fragmentation was only observed at doses where reduced mechanical properties were also observed (17,000 and 35,000 Gy; Figure ). Thus, our results suggest that the fragmentation of collagen   and not the accumulation of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks   was the primary molecular mechanism that caused the observed reductions in mechanical properties in whole bones exposed to ionizing radiation. Our results are consistent with previous radiation studies and provide novel insight into the effect of ex vivo ionizing radiation on bone mechanics. In accordance with previous investigations of cortical bone, we observed  reduction in both monotonic and fatigue properties at  dose equivalent to nominal allograft sterilization of ~30,000   ,000 Gy [10,15,20,37 39], and  reduction of monotonic strength at 17,000 Gy [11]. While our study is consistent with earlier observations, our findings expand upon previous knowledge in three important areas. First, previous inquiries have been conducted on either cortical [10,11,15,20,37 39] or trabecular [40] bone tissue specimens, not whole-bones. Second, mechanical characterization has been primarily conducted in either monotonic or fatigue loading conditions, not both. Finally, only  subset of these studies has conducted concurrent collagen biochemical analysis, quantifying either crosslinks [13] or fragmentation [10,37,39]. For the first time, we have demonstrated the effect of irradiation on whole-bones (with both cortical and trabecular tissue) across  spectrum of clinically-relevant doses (.. radiation therapy at 50 Gy to allograft sterilization at 35,000 Gy) with both monotonic and fatigue mechanical tests, as well as parallel collagen biochemical assays. We expand on the Pendleton et al. Page  Bone. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 November 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nwork of Currey et al. [11] and demonstrate that in addition to  reduction in monotonic strength following irradiation at 17,000 Gy, fatigue properties are also significantly reduced. Importantly, we have demonstrated the doses at which the differences in collagen structure and mechanics arise. Our results provide new insight into the type of molecular change driving the degradation of whole-bone strength and fatigue life following irradiation. While the exact collagen modifications dominating reduced strength following irradiation are not fully understood, we examined the two proposed mechanisms: photon-induced fragmentation of the collagen backbone [10,20] or radiolysis-induced non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks [12,13,21 23]. Our results suggest that increased collagen fragmentation, and not non-enzymatic crosslinking, is the dominant factor. While no previous studies have quantified the fragmentation of collagen in irradiated whole-bones, our results are in agreement with previous work on cortical bone, which demonstrated that diminished fracture toughness at doses of ~35,000 Gy was  result of collagen fragmentation [10,37]. Expanding on this knowledge, we demonstrate that collagen fragmentation leads to degraded murine whole-bone mechanics at 17,000 Gy,  dose signifiantly lower than the standard for allograft sterilization (25,000   35,000 Gy). Our findings emphasize the need for further research into novel radioprotectants that target fragmentation in order to maintain bone strength when sterilizing allografts with radiation [10]. Importantly, our findings suggest that non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks may play  smaller role in degrading mechanical strength of bone than previously considered. Previously, numerous studies attributed the increase in non-enzymatic crosslink concentration as the primary mechanism for degraded bone strength, specifically in applications of natural aging [24,36,41], drug treatments [42], irradiation sterilization [13], and diseases such as osteoporosis [43] and diabetes [26,44 47].",

Previously, numerous studies attributed the increase in non-enzymatic crosslink concentration as the primary mechanism for degraded bone strength, specifically in applications of natural aging [24,36,41], drug treatments [42], irradiation sterilization [13], and diseases such as osteoporosis [43] and diabetes [26,44 47]. While the concentration of non-enzymatic crosslinks does accumulate in bone collagen in these applications, any causation of those crosslinks with respect to degraded mechanical properties has not been established. Here, we observed that despite  substantial (95%) increase in crosslink concentration, we could not detect any effect on vertebral strength. Indeed, studies have demonstrated that an increase in non-enzymatic crosslinks induced via ribose incubation can be used to counter the loss of strength due to the fragmentation of the collagen network, not degrade it further [39,48,49]. Taken together, our results strengthen the argument that the contribution of non-enzymatic crosslinks to diminished bone strength with disease and aging plays  smaller role in comparison to other factors, such as collagen network connectivity [50]. There are some limitations in this study. First, because we tested mouse bone, the direct application of our findings to human bone is unclear. However, as discussed above, similar trends in irradiation-induced degraded bone strength [10,11,15,20,37 39,51 55] and molecular-level changes [10,55] have been seen in other studies across  number of anatomic sites and species, including human bone. That consistency suggests our results are not limited to murine bone. Second, as an ex vivo study, we excluded the impact of any biologically induced responses to radiation in order to explore the extent to which radiation directly alters the mechanical behavior of the bone matrix. For applications of allograft sterilization, which are only conducted ex vivo, excluding cellular effects is appropriate. However, for in vivo applications of radiation therapy, there can be cellular-driven changes, Pendleton et al. Page  Bone. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 November 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nsuch as reduced bone volume fraction or altered trabecular microarchitecture [50], which can alter bone mechanics beyond what is reported here. Thus, our method of irradiation is directly comparable to ex vivo allograft sterilization; for doses equivalent to in vivo radiotherapy treatment (50 Gy), our method is only applicable when considering the direct effects of radiation on the bone matrix. Additionally, we performed all mechanical tests, monotonic and cyclic, in compression. While compressive loading is most relevant for in vivo behavior, the response may be different for isolated specimens tested in pure tension. Finally, because our study did not investigate doses between ,000 and 17,000 Gy, it is unclear at what dose within this range reduced mechanical properties can first be observed. To address this gap, we conducted  post-hoc study for doses of ,000 and 10,000 Gy (see Appendix) with the same mechanical and biochemical assays described above. We found some mechanical differences occurred with radiation exposure of ,000 Gy (and above), but only for cyclic loading: compared to the control, fatigue life was lower by 18% ( < .01) but monotonic strength was not different ( = .12). These ad hoc results confirm previous observations that cyclic loading may be  more sensitive test than monotonic loading for detecting mechanical effects of radiation [13,20]. Clinically, radiation-induced fractures are often observed months to years after irradiation and classified as spontaneous or insufficiency fractures (.. fractures which are not the result of  fall or trauma, and more likely due to repetitive loading at low forces over time) [56 58]. As such, it is clinically important to consider mechanisms that can affect cyclic loading properties differently than static loading properties. Furthermore, our findings have expanded our knowledge to show fatigue properties are also significantly reduced with doses as low as ,000 Gy. Clinically, our results have implications for safe sterilization of allografts and potential radioprotectants. dose of 11,000 Gy has been proposed as  safe sterilization dose for allografts [59], as this dose achieves the same sterility level as the current standard dose of 30,000   ,000 Gy [,]. However, our supplemental findings suggest collagen fragmentation and associated loss of cyclic mechanical properties can begin with  dose as low as ,000 Gy (see Appendix). To mitigate the loss of mechanical integrity, further studies are needed to investigate how to safeguard the bone with  radioprotectant. Several radioprotectants have been considered for their ability to preserve tissue properties following irradiation [,49,60]. Based on our results, we would recommend studies focused on radioprotectants which can prevent or offset the fragmentation of collagen, as these types of radioprotectants may preserve bone mechanics to  greater degree than those which protect against non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks. Our results also have implications for understanding the etiology of the increased fracture risk associated with in vivo radiation therapy treatment for cancer [,,61 66]. We did not observe any change in mechanical behavior for ex vivo dose levels relevant to radiation therapy (.. 50 Gy), despite an increase in collagen crosslinks. Thus, direct effects of radiation on the collagen matrix from radiation therapy are not solely responsible for the increased fracture risk observed clinically. From this, we can infer that the cellular processes of bone remodeling due to in vivo irradiation are likely the root cause. Indeed, previous in vivo irradiation studies of bone in  murine model have shown reduced trabecular bone mass, number and connectivity associated with hyperactive osteoclast activity [67 69]. Pendleton et al. Page  Bone. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 November 01. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nTaken together with our ex vivo observations, cell-mediated changes in bone quantity, trabecular microarchitecture, or tissue material quality are more plausible explanations for the increased fracture risk from radiation therapy than direct changes to the bone material. In summary, we quantified the level of collagen fragmentation and non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks in the organic matrix of murine whole-bones at clinically-relevant ex vivo radiation doses. Our results suggest that the fragmentation of collagen   and not the accumulation of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks   was the primary molecular mechanism that caused the observed monotonic mechanical degradation at 17,000 Gy and above, and cyclic mechanical degradation at ,000 Gy and above.

As detailed above, we measured mechanical properties, collagen crosslinks, and collagen fragmentation (data not shown). We observed compressive fatigue life to be lower for the irradiated groups, being 18% ( < .01) and 37% ( < .0001) lower for ,000 and 10,000 Gy doses, respectively, compared to the control (. . log(cycles)). We detected no significant effect of radiation dose for any of the compressive monotonic mechanical properties, either for strength ( = .12), stiffness ( = .62), or maximum displacement ( = .51). Collagen crosslinks increased significantly for all irradiated groups, by 71% and 101% for ,000 and 10,000 Gy, respectively ( < .05). Collagen fragmentation was evident for ,000 Gy, observed as  significant decrease in the amount of nominally sized collagen chains (~150 kDa) compared to the  Gy control ( = .008); data for the 10,000 Gy group was lost due to  processing error. These findings suggest that doses well below sterilization standards (30,000   ,000 Gy) and  proposed alternative (11,000 Gy) may compromise the mechanical strength and collagen integrity of bone allografts, making them more susceptible to failure under cyclic loading [,,59].

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nHighlights   Ex vivo ionizing radiation of whole-bones caused  reduction in compressive monotonic strength and fatigue life. Decreased strength was best explained by collagen fragmentation, not the accumulation of non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks. Non-enzymatic collagen crosslinks may play  smaller role in degrading mechanical strength of bone than previously considered. Irradiation has unique effects on cyclic behavior that are not manifested in static behavior. Pendleton et al. Page 15 Bone. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2020 November 01.

In this piece, we lay out several pressing issues related to ethical considerations for selecting space travelers and conducting human subject research on them, especially in the context of non-governmental and commercial/private space operations. It has been over 50 years since the  rst human walked on the Moon. Since then, most commercialized space ights have been contracts granted to private companies by various governments to launch satellites, .., communication and GPS devices, into Earth  orbit. In recent years, the de nition of commercial space ight has expanded to include human transportation between Earth and habitats in Low Earth Orbit and future lunar or other extraterrestrial outposts. Once considered nearly impossible, commercial space travel is now  reality, due to rapid technological advancement in the private sector, large- scale investment from governments, and continued public interest. With the  rst crewed launch of SpaceX Dragon to the International Space Station (ISS), on May 30, 20201,  new era of public-private space ight partnership has emerged.

NASA has further partnered with Axiom Space for commercial utilization of the ISS until the world   rst commercial space station is built by 20282. There is currently  wide range of private/commercial space ights, ranging from suborbital  ights lasting mere minutes to Axiom  - week ISS missions to the  rst all-civilian orbital commercial space ight mission referred to as  Inspiration4  (I4), comparable in duration (and health risks) to orbital shuttle missions1 . Historically, government-sponsored space ights were mission- based and geared towards national interests, .., technological lea- dership, improving national security, creating high-quality jobs, or advancements in research. After the Cold War era and the  Space Race,  government investment in space exploration declined. In con- trast, the idea of commercial space ight continues to gain signi cant popularity and the economic opportunities linked to this are enor- mous. This has been accompanied by an in ux of investment and the development of new technology, such as initial viable Reusable Launch Vehicle models by SpaceX4. Despite this rapid technology develop- ment, governmental regulation of commercial space ight lags behind. There are some requirements commercial space ight providers have to meet, including requirements concerning environmental safety, payload, payload re-entry,  nancial stability, and coverage for max- imum probable loss5. Yet, there has been only limited regulation concerning the selection and training of non-government-sponsored astronauts and no formal oversight governing medical research on such crews, whether orbital or suborbital. The United Nations Of ce for Outer Space Affairs has collated national space laws relating to space activities from 42 countries6. While the regulations listed there cover  wide range of  elds, such as objects in space, radio- communication, and space activities, there is  general lack of health- associated regulations. This is  symptom of  bigger problem where there is little oversight of private sector space ight participants which, with Inspiration4, dearMoon7, and the upcoming Polaris program8, are already  reality. An increase in commercial/private and civilian space missions with  more diverse crew may provide an opportunity to collect data on health issues in space. While these data could shape medical stan- dards and improve treatment choices for prolonged space ight, their collection and management should require strict regulation. At the same time, as spacefarers shift from professionally trained astronauts to private individuals without rigorous preparation or with existing medical conditions, there is  need to re ne selection criteria and training for non-governmental space travelers. Yet, despite their importance and urgency, these considerations have gone relatively unexplored9. In this paper, we will lay out several pressing issues related to ethical considerations for selecting space travelers and research practices, especially in the context of non-governmental and private space operations. Although there are many other ethical issues related to space exploration   both commercial and otherwise10 19  our focus here is on ethical considerations regarding selection and human sub- ject research. Note that while some of the issues we raise might be covered by guidelines, regulations, or law, this does not diminish the ethical considerations we discuss. good example illustrating this point is NASA  recent decision to unify the effective radiation expo- sure for male and female astronauts so as to not exceed 600 mSv, which translates to having to remain below % mean risk of cancer mortality above the non-exposed baseline mean, despite differences in male and female radiation-based cancer risk20,21. This decision is highly controversial, precisely because it is viewed by many as ethically pro- blematic. Likewise, signing  consent form to undertake  certain activity (whether employer-mandated or not) does not make the proposed activity or consent process ethically unquestionable21. Indeed, our point here is that ethical considerations resulting from the increase in private and commercial space ight arise despite estab- lished rules and guidelines22,23. note on terminology: SpaceX, Axiom, and others refer to their travelers as  crew . This has important consequences since the limited Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) guidelines24 that are applicable to non-professional astronauts are somewhat more stringent for crew than  ordinary  space ight occupants. To bypass ambiguity, we prefer the term  space ight occupants  (SOs), using it to refer to non- professional space travelers lacking substantial space ight training. Further, we use the terms  laws  and  regulations  to refer to binding law and the neutral terms  guidelines ,  recommendations , and  policy  to refer to non-binding guiding instruments. Considerations on governmental vs. non- governmental space ight Biological hazards of space ight The selection of professional astronauts is highly regulated because space travel and habitation are demanding and dangerous. Current space missions to the ISS in Low Earth Orbit and future missions pushing the boundaries of human space exploration towards the Moon and Mars are characterized by exposure to space radiation, such as galactic cosmic rays (GCR), solar particle events (SPE), and trapped radiation25, changing gravity  elds, acceleration/deceleration phenomena26, isolation, and con nement27 in  hostile and closed environment28 and,  nally, the increasingly far distance from Earth (Fig. ). Exposure to GCR/SPE is potentially the most signi cant single health hazard for Low Earth Orbit; for deep-space crewed missions beyond the Earth  protective magnetic  eld this risk pro le increases dramatically28. Recently, NASA increased an individualastronaut  total career effective radiation dose (independent of age at exposure and sex) due to space ight radiation exposure to less than 600 mSv, translating into  mean risk increase of cancer mortality (REID) of below % above the non-exposed baseline mean21. This change was implemented following  study carried out under the auspices of the National Academies of Sciences29. However, these standards remain controversial, especially in light of predicted REID ranging between - 10% for females exposed at ages 20, 40, and 60 years for  simulated Mars Mission20. Of note, most international partners use  higher career dose limit of ,000mSV (independent of sex and age). Health concerns and ethical considerations regarding commercial space travel are of great importance considering that the aforemen- tioned potential hazards can severely interfere with many physiologi- cal processes, such as physiological homeostasis on  cellular and Distance Confinement Hostile and closed environments Changing gravity fields Galactic cosmic rays Fig. | The Five Hazards in Space Contributing to Increased Health Risks.

Furthermore, several space hazards cause DNA damage28,30, affect telomere length30, induce signi cant differences in DNA methylation, and alter accessibility of chromatin regions and speci  DNA epitopes30,34. Such cellular and molecular effects lead to serious pathophysiology and health consequences25, including but not limited to: changes in the cardiovascular system including  uid shifts, ortho- static intolerance, reduced ventricle size, thrombus formation28,35 39, musculoskeletal defects de ned as muscle atrophy and bone loss30,40 42, central nervous system alterations including  uid shifts, neurocognitive and psychiatric alteration and Space-Associated Neuro-ocular Syndrome (SANS)43,44, immune system dysfunction, initiation of malignant processes45 due to loss of DNA integrity, failed DNA repair mechanisms, mutations, and chromosomal rearrangements46. Nevertheless, while knowledge mounts, there remains  lack of data addressing individual differences among astronauts, such as age, sex, and genetic background, contributing to the challenges of accurately predicting radiation hazards and outcomes28. Ethical issues related to the dangers and selection of SOs Given these signi cant space ight hazards, stringent selection criteria are important to protect astronaut and SO health and to help ensure that missions can be completed successfully. For instance, the ISS Multilateral Space Medicine Board provides guidance about travel to the ISS by private individuals47,48 and NASA has signi cantly strength- ened its health-oriented recommendations and guidelines over the last two decades. Similarly, independent organizations such as the Aero- space Medical Association, have issued policies and guidelines taking into consideration not just the physical health of SOs but also their mental health49.",

Ethical issues related to the dangers and selection of SOs Given these signi cant space ight hazards, stringent selection criteria are important to protect astronaut and SO health and to help ensure that missions can be completed successfully. For instance, the ISS Multilateral Space Medicine Board provides guidance about travel to the ISS by private individuals47,48 and NASA has signi cantly strength- ened its health-oriented recommendations and guidelines over the last two decades. Similarly, independent organizations such as the Aero- space Medical Association, have issued policies and guidelines taking into consideration not just the physical health of SOs but also their mental health49. There are not only expansive rules and guidelines at the selection and annual re-evaluation stage for astronauts, but also stringent health monitoring before, during, and after space ight50. However, with increasing commercial and private space ight oppor- tunities, it is no longer just trained and pre-screened astronauts who travel to space. Since existing guidance in its various forms applies mostly to government-sponsored or -employed professional astro- nauts, the question arises as to who determines whether the potential health risks associated with space ight are acceptable or not in the case of SOs. Current guidance on its own is not in  good position to resolve some of the issues that will arise in these new contexts. Both medical and scienti  research communities as well as  number of govern- ments have long and carefully deliberated about medical and ethical scenarios and questions that might arise during space ight. However, while some of their guidelines might apply to certain instances of, say, paying SOs (for example, private astronauts travelling to the ISS and therefore covered by ISS rules), there is still  relative dearth of dis- cussion concerning how to extend these important deliberations to the new types of SO that we are likely to see in the coming decades. Moreover, since existing law and policy frameworks were designed mostly with government-employed or -sponsored astronauts in mind, their scope does not always extend neatly to their non- governmental counterparts. For instance, federal space agencies form an employer-employee relationship with their astronauts. While this might be applicable to some kinds of potential commercial SOs, it will not be applicable to private SOs. For example, while the International Commission on Radiological Protection stresses the importance of radiological protection, in the .. the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP)51 explicitly states that its pur- view is  NASA selection of astronauts for participation in space mis- sions  and that  the measures suggested in this Report may be unique to NASA and not generalizable . Although the re nements proposed by the NCRP to NASA  shared decision-making framework do not directly pertain to commercial and private SOs, their relevance is evi- dent and should be taken into consideration. One might think that general documents of medical research ethics could provide some help here. For example, the World Medical Association  (WMA)  Declaration of Helsinki  (DoH)52 is one of the most in uential and important sets of ethical principles concerning medical research involving human subjects. While the WMA has no formal authority or binding status, it is still often expected that guidelines concerning research ethics will look to the DoH as  guiding document. However, the DoH is neither accepted by all countries nor uncontroversial. For example, Sch klenk and Ashcroft53 have high- lighted both the  absence of  consensus over the actual content of the Declaration and its status , and stressed its  continuing lack of  ser- ious consultation with the relevant stakeholders , while also empha- sizing the more general  absence of  consensus among knowledgeable, well-intentioned bioethicists, scientists and political activists over the central issue of research ethics standards . There is also  heated debate about whether there exists an international consensus opinion that violates and diverges from the DoH  principles54,55. Macklin has argued that, even with revisions, the DoH  cannot resolve ongoing controversies , since  it simply does not address other aspects of international research about which people disagree 56. Macklin has further stressed con icts between the DoH and  of cial regulations promulgated by  federal agency, with enforcement mechanisms and sanctions for noncompliance  and pointed out that  it is hardly surprising that researchers, ethical review bodies, and governmental agencies do not consider the Declaration of Helsinki to be  necessary adjunct to the  of cial  CommonRule, which governs most federally funded research in the United States 56. Indeed, the US FDA  rst rejected the 2000 and later revisions, before elim- inating all references to the DoH in 200657. The situation is not dis- similar in many other countries and regions. Documents such as the Altered microbiome composition Mitochondrial dysregulation Epigenetic changes Oxidative stress Telomeric length changes DNA damage Cardiovascular changes CNS alteration Musculoskeletal changes Immune system dysfunction Altered circadian rhythm Increased cancer risk Fig. | Biological and Health Features of Space ight. Space hazards, as outlined in Fig. , drive  diverse array of molecular and cellular changes observed during space ight, including DNA damage, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysregulation, alteration in the microbiome composition, epigenetic changes, and telomere length changes. Such features will have the potential to induce pathophysiologic system changes affecting the central nervous system, the cardiovascular system, immune functions, musculoskeletal dynamics, the circadian rhythm, and cancer risk in SOs. Perspective  Nature Communications| (2024) 15:4774\n\nDoH   regardless of its controversies   are much too general to resolve particular ethical conundrums related to human space travel. Thus, while they might provide some necessary restrictions and sometimes even positive guidance, the question of how such general principles apply to speci  and concrete cases, especially when there is little precedent, requires further examination. This of course is just one reason why agencies around the world spend enormous efforts on crafting guidelines and recommendations about the ethics of human subject research in space. But who will do the same for those space travelers to whom these do not apply? The relevant international legal framework, .. the  ve UN Space Treaties, do not speci cally address the health of astronauts or other space ight participants6. The Outer Space Treaty (OST) of 1967 introduces the concept of  envoys of mankind  for astronauts58; the Rescue and Return Agreement (RRA) extends this protection to  per- sonnel of spacecraft . However, neither of these terms is clearly de ned and terminological inconsistencies have led to  broad inter- pretation, suggesting that the Agreement extends to human life in outer space or space ight generally, covering both professional and non-professional space travelers, including tourists. However, these agreements were drafted at  time when activities such as space tourism were unforeseen, posing challenges in predicting and reg- ulating health concerns for modern space activities. Thus, these agreements lack explicit health regulations for individuals that are part of the private space industry and, even if such regulations existed, enforcing them would be challenging due to the absence of robust enforcement mechanisms in international law. To address issues such as these at the US-level, the FAA59 and NASA entered  Memorandum of Understanding in June 2012, to coordinate standards for commercial government or non-government astronaut transport to and from Low Earth Orbit and the ISS. The goal was to foster both public and crew safety, avoid con icting rules and guidelines, as well as to provide  framework for the American space industry. Despite this, the clearance of  ordinary  SOs for space ight is currently the responsibility of commercial providers, with limited oversight, and  lack of standardized screening procedures and protocols60. The US is currently the main country providing such guidance in the form of the FAA Recommended Practices for Human Space Flight Occupant Safety. However, due to the limits of FAA jur- isdiction, these guidelines only apply to launch and reentry61. Further, the FAA guidance comes not in the form of mandatory requirements but rather as (minimal) recommendations, suggesting merely that  [] roximate to  ight, the operator should require each space  ight par- ticipant to consult with  physician, trained or experienced in aero- space medicine, to ascertain their personal medical risks from the space  ight pro le and vehicle  (2023: . ..). It also explicitly states that  []his document does not include any speci  medical criteria that would limit who should   in space as  space  ight participant. (2023: . .). Thus, given that medical consultation is only  recom- mendation, in principle anyone capable of giving written informed consent can  , regardless of their health pro le, as long as they meet speci ed space ight operator criteria (Fig. ). This raises  number of issues. First, if an SO fails to be cleared by one physician, can they get clearance from  more lenient provider elsewhere?62 As Langston points out,  []edical forum shopping is  foreseeable ethical and legal concern where regulatory standardization is lacking or is inconsistent between jurisdictions  [which] could lead to increased risk of harm for the individual (in- ight/post- ight), space ight and crew, as well as uninvolved third parties 63. This scenario parallels  situation seen in the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration64, where  disquali ed driver can apply for  resolution if  disagreement exists in regard to the medical quali cation exam. However, to oversee potential medical forum shopping, all results from medical examinations have to be entered into the centralized National Registry, preventing the con- tinued medical examination until  desired result is achieved and certi ed. Second, there might be tension between the potential clearance requirements desirable for  commercial space ight operator or pro- vider   who might have an interest in lenient requirements to sell as many seats as possible to the limited pool of individuals who can afford them   and those desirable from the health standpoint of  particular SO. One might argue that SOs should undergo relevant medical con- sultations and decide on the risks they are willing to take, similar to making choices about risky adventures on Earth. So why should they not be in  position to make similar decisions for space? Nonetheless, Variable Health Status Stringent astronaut selection criteria as defined by NASA / ESA / JAXA Less defined selection criteria for commercial space travelers Stringent government-driven selection criteria vs. minimal oversight for private SOs Established policies and ethical guidelines vs. lack of comprehensive regulations Regulatory framework for astronaut health vs. uncertainties and inconsistencies in SOs' health assessments Fig. | Differential Approaches to Selecting SOs. Stringent selection criteria (green) for government-sponsored astronauts (.., NASA, ESA, JAXA), including  hard stop mechanism are depicted on the right of the schematic (right dashed red line). Less de ned commercial space traveler criteria for civilians (red)  nally leading to rejection (left dashed red line) are indicated. The green-red color-coded middle area symbolizes the health-related risks, where the array of potential commercial space selection criteria is located. Perspective  Nature Communications| (2024) 15:4774\n\nwhile legal and social norms allow people to engage in some risks, the same norms do not give blanket allowance for people to do anything they want, instead exercising various degrees of paternalistic oversight both in people  private and public lives (for an overview of paternal- ism and its issues, see Dworkin 2020)65. For example, many govern- ments require drivers and passengers to wear seatbelts, they require motorcyclists to wear helmets, forbid the sale of certain drugs, they forbid people to enter into certain kinds of contracts (for selling organs, gambling debts, etc.). Questions thus arise about the appro- priate degree of paternalistic oversight for space travel, as well as questions about who has the power to enforce relevant policies and regulations. further complication   and again one that speaks in favor of increased guidance or regulation   is that compromised SO health might also affect fellow passengers. In fact, the September 2023 revisions of the FAA recommendations now recognize this problem at least partially, stating that  []edical consultation for space  ight participants is recommended   to help prevent them from endan- gering other occupants  .",

In fact, the September 2023 revisions of the FAA recommendations now recognize this problem at least partially, stating that  []edical consultation for space  ight participants is recommended   to help prevent them from endan- gering other occupants  . [and] commercial operators will be chal- lenged to control hazards to space  ight participants from other space  ight participants with medical conditions. 61 This is, of course, also  problem with respect to various forms of ground and air transporta- tion; however, it is exacerbated in the case of space travel. For one, providing assistance in space is more dif cult than on the ground or in the air, thus putting fellow travelers in  position in which they are more likely to compromise their own safety during the course of providing help, especially in the absence of mandatory training. Fur- ther, space travel has inherent limits about the amount and kind of medical equipment that can be transported and effectively used in  space ight environment. Third, even if stringent screening requirements are in place, substantial uncertainties remain regarding the various health con- sequences of space travel, making it virtually impossible for speci  individuals to understand what their actual health risks are, even if advised by someone  trained or experienced in aerospace medicine 61. Current data insuf ciently address individual differences among astronauts such as age, sex, and genetic background66, which trans- lates into signi cant uncertainty in predicting individualized space radiation hazards and outcomes for both astronauts and SOs67. In addition, while it is known that individuals metabolize drugs and supplements differently in space68 70, little to nothing is known about the physiology underlying these changes. Limited available data70 suggests that even relatively common prescription drugs might work differently in space. Furthermore, the reduced and often unknown stability of pharmacologic ingredients and supplements over the course of exploration-rated space missions becomes even more critical70. Specially prepared space medications, appropriate repacka- ging to improve pharmaceutical stability, and more insight into indi- vidual pharmacokinetics are needed to supply both astronauts and SOs with effective pharmaceuticals and/or other treatment options. All of these considerations strongly suggest that some guidance and/or oversight with respect to potential SO screening and clearance would be highly bene cial (Fig. ). In fact, this is not just so for the SOs, but also for the commercial providers who agree to transport them. While SOs are currently required to sign liability waivers, the legal status of these waivers is unclear, and so binding rules might also provide  way for providers to indemnify themselves against future lawsuits71. However, such rules should be sensitive to the diversity and variety of potential space ight endeavors: there is  difference between  private citizen enjoying  suborbital  ight and  commercial crew member spending prolonged time in space for research pur- poses, perhaps on  commercial space station. Human subject research As our technical and research abilities evolve, so do the ethical con- siderations for using human subjects for research. While NASA estimated the chance of survival of the  rst mission to the Moon (Apollo ) at 50-50, such odds for harm would not be accepted for any present-day study involving human subjects (recollection quoted from Ref. 72). NASA  ethical principles are de ned to ensure human research subject welfare and minimize health risks. Further, research protocols can be implemented only if  risk/bene  analysis demon- strates that the risks to the subjects are reasonable in relation to the anticipated bene ts and the expected importance of new knowledge. This will become even more important for missions to Mars73. In addition to the prevention of direct harm, other important con- siderations include protecting privacy, ensuring strict data security, and maximizing the positive social impacts of research. Human Subject Research projects in space, supported or other- wise subject to regulation by any US federal department or agency, are strictly regulated under the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR pt 123069). Based on this, the implementation, procedures, and requirements to conduct space-related research involving human subjects is tightly controlled within  binding framework. NASA Insti- tutional Review Board (IRB) committees review such research propo- sals to guarantee enforcement of these policies and the ethical, safe, and equitable treatment of human research subjects. In addition, the Of ce of Research Assurance ensures that all activities comply with applicable federal regulations and guidelines, ensuring that human subject welfare and minimal health risk are prioritized for all decisions. Such analysis will not take into account potential long-term effects on public policies. An interesting variation from non-NASA research pro- tocols is the requirement that the responsible  ight surgeon maintains the duty to intervene and terminate ongoing research if the health and welfare of astronaut research subjects is in question. While the NASA IRB process adheres to standard practices for IRBs, it has unique aspects focused on human subjects  well-being beyond typical standards. The highest level of concern involves human subject research studies involving genetic testing. NASA de nes genetic testing based on the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act74. Studies involving genetic testing in human subjects are deemed of the highest concern and automatically categorized as  greater than minimal risk , according to NASA75. These studies require additional measures to protect the research subjects, including policies that prohibit the public release of genetic data without prior approval from the individual or their direct family members, in accordance with NASA policy. NASA enforces strict rules as genetic data must be stored separately, and cross-referencing is forbidden without IRB approval. After genetic testing, all electronic data is deleted and given solely to NASA. However, commercial institutions or providers using services at NASA facilities to launch  space vehicle do not have to adhere to such rules in the same way. While the above-described scenarios are focused on NASA, the processes for international ISS partner research are not demon- strating signi cant national differences. In general, plans for research involving human research subjects are carefully examined by the ethics committee of the researcher  university or institute, the space agency proposing the research, and the space agency of the astro- naut subject. Furthermore, the Human Research Multilateral Review Board (HRMRB), comprising the representatives of space agencies involved in the ISS (NASA, ESA, CSA, JAXA), is tasked with investi- gating and reviewing ethical matters on the ISS. For all research conducted on an astronaut, the HRMRB looks at whether the safety and health of the astronaut are assured and whether the appropriate ethical considerations have been made. As necessary, the HRMRB then issues recommendations or modi cation requests. While government-sponsored human subject research is strictly regulated, it is still unclear whether future commercial SOs will be covered under such regulations, or if adherence to government regulations needs to be amended to re ect the new reality of space human subject research. Perspective  Nature Communications| (2024) 15:4774\n\nEthical considerations To date, our knowledge regarding the effects of space ight on humans, as well as the ef cacy and safety of select medical interven- tions and pharmaceuticals in space, comes from government- sponsored missions,  small number of astronauts, and, more recently, civilians (Inspiration4, MS-20, Axiom-)76,77. Increasing this type of knowledge is vital to ensuring the safety of future astronauts and SOs, especially considering the limited opportunities for medical treatment in space. It is therefore likely that astronauts and SOs will need to monitor, diagnose, and treat themselves at least part of the time. Increased commercial and private space ight opportunities will bring with them an expanding diversity of SOs with different health pro les, most of them likely not in the same physical and psychological shape as highly trained career astronauts78 80. By necessity, increasing knowledge about the effects of the space ight environment on human molecular biology, physiology, and psychology, as well as on the chemical composition of pharmaceuticals, involves human subject research. With the success of the recent Inspiration4 mission in de ning  wide range of biomedical data, the role of commercial and private SOs in such research is likely to increase. As previously outlined, government-sponsored space ights adhere to stringent criteria with respect to human subject research, through their respective IRBs, ethics committees, and groups. In the case of Inspiration4, research was conducted through Weill Cornell Medicine, the Translational Research Institute for Space Health of the Baylor College of Medicine81, California Institute of Technology, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology and underwent similarly rig- orous approval processes82. As the general standard for human subject research requires compliance with ethics approvals, it is expected that commercial space ight-based human subject research will continue to follow these and other applicable internationally rati ed pro- cesses (Fig. ). However, commercial space ight also raises new ethical issues. In the past, human subject research in space was mostly  secondary concern of overall missions whereas now missions are increasingly conducted explicitly for this purpose. Ethical recruitment for biome- dical research requires informed consent. For space travel, this requires participants to have  good understanding of the space environment, the nature of associated environmental hazards, as well as the potential side effects of any drugs under study51. But to what extent is such consent really possible with respect to space travel?83 Exposure to high radiation, microgravity, and galactic rays may com- promise participant safety in  number of unknown ways. Further, the effect of radiation and other extra-terrestrial factors on the chemical composition of pharmaceutical ingredients is largely unknown, thus making it especially dif cult to inform potential subjects about likely side effects. The US Code of Regulations for informed consent requires   description of any reasonably foreseeable risks or discomforts to the subject  (Title 45, .. Part 46.116, b282). In the case of space travel, where many or most risks are unknown, it is unclear to what extent   if at all   this requirement can be met. Thus, there is  need to incor- porate new and emerging ethical issues into existing frameworks in ways that are based on the same underlying ethical principles that gave rise to these and similar regulations in the  rst place and that are applicable to space travel. This is all the more urgent since civilians are already involved in such research51. Note also that the aforementioned problems are exacerbated for non-astronaut SOs: most of the existing data is not from  random population, but rather from an elite force Fig. | Human Subject Research Ethical and Operational Guidelines. sche- matic for the ethical framework for space human subject research.

Additionally, it has been established that even highly trained individuals respond quite differ- ently to the zero-gravity environment84. Moreover, existing research was conducted on  population with  high degree of sex, gender, and ethnic homogeneity and relatively low diversity. Currently, it is therefore unclear to what extent this research generalizes to SOs beyond the relatively narrow population that has been studied so far. Furthermore, principles of health ethics encompass avoiding harm, bene cence, achieving  favorable risk-bene  balance, respecting autonomy, fairness, and  delity85. Terrestrial clinical trials rely on large participant numbers, secure drug storage, and timely sample collection, which are dif cult to replicate in space. How to ensure compliance with these principles in space thus remains uncertain. There are also some concerns about individual principles: For example, human subject research in space may violate  partici- pant  autonomy, should the individual decide to withdraw from the study. In terrestrial medical research, subjects may at any time with- draw their consent, even if the study is already in progress. Such withdrawal, however, is much more complicated in space. Even if individuals are able to drop out, return to Earth will not be immediate. There is also no way for individuals to withdraw from the possible (unknown) long-term effects of the space ight environment, and any consent thus involves not just consent to the study itself, but consent to any future effects that might result from space ight activities. This might also lead to violating the Avoiding Harm principle, since remaining in space is unhealthy for participants, especially if the desired withdrawal occurs as the result of unforeseen health problems. In turn, these conditions might then violate the Favorable Risk and Bene  Balance, due to the changing circumstances during the course of research. In NASA  case, the responsible  ight surgeon can inter- rupt trials. However, in the absence of of cial, government-sanctioned  ight surgeons with extensive space ight experience, who assumes the equivalent responsibilities for SO healthcare, ensuring subjects  best interests are met? These problems represent only  small subset of issues, demon- strating the urgent need for guidance on non-government space research on human subjects (for further issues relating to privacy and behavioral health, see86,87). Such research should follow strict ethics committee review and otherwise meet the same stringent standards that NASA, ESA, and JAXA currently adhere to88, including following suggestions by international medical research bodies, such as the DoH, The Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences  International Ethical Guidelines for Health-Related Research Involving Humans89, and others. Conclusion We are entering an exciting new era of space exploration previously only thought of as science  ction. Commercial/private and civilian space ights, such as Inspiration4 and the Polaris missions are no longer just  possibility but  reality. Exciting as these opportunities are, they also come with the burden of ensuring that future space travel will be as safe and ethical as possible. While governmental oversight has historically governed space activities, the emergence of non-governmental initiatives calls for uni ed ethical guidelines, safe- guarding human well-being during selection, research, and decision- making in space. Since non-governmental out ts are not bound by the same rules in the same way, we as  community must ensure that the guidelines we set will guide space exploration according to the highest ethical and medical standards for humans that are currently possible, including selection of SOs, medical research ranging from human subject research to discussion of in- ight triage decisions. The added dif culties of non-universal terminology referring to different kinds of space travelers and of making guidelines sensitive to the diversity and variety of potential space ight endeavors will add further layers of complexity. The earlier and better any such guidelines can be imple- mented, the better the chances that space travel can be performed according to the safest and most optimal standards. References .

Sci. 2022, 23, 7465  of 31 Abstract: Outer space is an extremely hostile environment for human life, with ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays and microgravity posing the most signi cant hazards to the health of astronauts. Space ight has also been shown to have an impact on established cancer hallmarks, pos- sibly increasing carcinogenic risk. Terrestrially, women have  higher incidence of radiation-induced cancers, largely driven by lung, thyroid, breast, and ovarian cancers, and therefore, historically, they have been permitted to spend signi cantly less time in space than men. In the present review, we focus on the effects of microgravity and radiation on the female reproductive system, particularly gynecological cancer. The aim is to provide  summary of the research that has been carried out related to the risk of gynecological cancer, highlighting what further studies are needed to pave the way for safer exploration class missions, as well as post ight screening and management of women astronauts following long-duration space ight. Keywords: space exploration; microgravity; space radiation; astronaut health; female reproductive system; gynecological cancers . Introduction Human space ight and deep space exploration are the aspirational activities of numer- ous national space agencies including the European Space Agency (ESA), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and Canadian Space Agency (CSA), as well as many commercial and other private entities. Studies to determine the long-term physiological responses and adaptation to the space environment and further re-adaptation to the environmental conditions on Earth are of crucial importance to the safety and health of the astronauts []. Beyond the stressors of getting to space, such as vibration and acceleration forces, microgravity and radiation are the most signi cant hazards during space travel []. There are other sources of physiological and psychological stress during space ight, including circadian shifting, dietary alterations, con ned spaces, and isolation []. The impact of space ight and the cosmic environment on those organ systems essential to carry out tasks in space (motor skills, cardiovascular system, and maintenance of overall bodily function) and which are essential upon return to Earth, have received the majority of focus as they relate to studies of astronaut health and wellbeing. long-standing concern has also been the effects of the cosmic environment on male and female reproductive health including carcinogenesis of the primary reproductive organs secondary to cosmic radiation exposure. However, this area of research lags behind. Advances in molecular biology, genetics, oncology and radiotherapy have provided more insights in recent years []; however, there is  paucity of research evaluating the risks of gynecological cancers, ovarian insuf ciency, or infertility following space ight. In the present review, we focus on the effects of microgravity and radiation on the female reproductive system, particularly gynecological cancer. The aim is to provide  summary of what is known so far from studies conducted on Earth, together with the research questions and challenges requiring further study to pave the way for safer exploration class missions, as well as post ight screening and management of female astronauts following long-duration space ight. . Space-Environmental Factors: Microgravity and Space Radiation Space travel, the  nal frontier, presents  challenge that few have faced before. Since the  rst  ight to space in 1961,  ve key threats to long-duration space travel have been identi ed: distance from Earth, isolation and con nement, hostile/closed environments, gravity (or lack thereof), and radiation []. These are all areas of potentially signi cant concern during long-duration space ight. An exploration-class mission to Mars is expected to last three years, all in an enclosed environment with  small crew [,]. At least one of these three years would include transit time in deep space during which microgravity\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7465  of 31 and radiation exposures would be elevated compared to the Martian surface. Previous literature highlights the harmful effects of such environments on several body systems, including cardiac, neurological, and immune functioning [,]. In addition to the elevated medical risks during exploration missions, triage and management of such conditions is complicated by limited resources, ability to evacuate, and ground communication abilities. The distance between the Earth base and Mars leads to  communication time delay of around  20 min one-way. This can be  particular challenge as the expertise available on Earth is no longer able to provide real-time assistance (as is the case for astronauts on the International Space Station). .. Microgravity Microgravity (or reduced gravity) leads to complex biological and systemic-level changes. Given that life has evolved and adapted to the presence of near-constant gravity on Earth, these changes can have consequences []. When exposed to altered gravity, these changes can be classi ed into short- or long-term effects. Over  few minutes of space ight, astronauts may experience space motion sickness []. Over  longer period, there can be remodeling of the cardiovascular and musculoskeletal systems []. The effects of microgravity on human physiology have been extensively investigated with the main goal of developing adequate countermeasures to minimize risks associated with long-duration space ight. These microgravity effects have been shown to be signi cant, global, and ampli ed with mission duration and distance from Earth. In particular, those associated with cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, neurological, and immune systems are easily diagnosed and clinically observable upon return from space. Microgravity may synergistically combine with other factors such as radiation, addi- tionally compromising the health and safety of the astronauts. However, though much is known about how microgravity can affect these bodily systems, research into sex/gender- related differences in the response and adaption to space ight as well as how microgravity can affect the female reproductive system is limited [10]. .. Space Radiation Radiation (as waves or particles) is energy that can be classi ed as non-ionizing (.., radiowaves, microwaves, infrared) or ionizing (.., - or gamma rays, protons, neutrons, heavy ions). However, ionizing radiation is the most biologically active. While popular culture imagines radiation stemming from nuclear meltdowns and atomic bombs like Chernobyl or Hiroshima, in medical practice, ionizing radiation plays critical roles in both imaging and cancer radiotherapies. In imaging, -rays and computed tomography provide critical information allowing clinicians to tailor further interventions. In contrast, when used in radiotherapies, ionizing radiation can be used to target  tumor with  minimal impact on surrounding tissue [11]. The total radiation dose is often delivered as  series of fractionated doses over the span of   weeks. Even though the exact treatment protocol varies depending upon the type and stage of the tumor itself, typical total doses used for the treatment of gynecological cancers range from around 40 60 Gray (Gy) [12]. Ionizing radiation can impact the cells directly, where the particles impact  vital target molecule and directly transfer their energy, or indirectly, where particles impact other molecules, such as water, leading to longer lasting, very reactive free radicals. When impacting DNA, ionizing radiation can cause single-strand or double-strand DNA breaks. Double-strand DNA breaks, especially those caused by close single hits or high-energy hits, are much harder to repair. Non-rejoined breaks can lead to cell death, while incorrectly rejoined breaks can lead to mutation. Space radiation has  complex impact on human tissues and is an etiological agent for cancer, cardiovascular diseases, central nervous system impairment, radiation sickness, and other harmful conditions [,13]. The Earth  magnetic  eld is  crucial protective element. Given the nature of ionizing space radiation, an increased rate of carcinogenesis is  primary concern for long-duration space ight [14]. While no increase in gynecologic\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7465  of 31 cancer risk has yet been revealed in the female astronaut population [15,16], as exploration missions will be outside of low Earth orbit and for increasingly long durations, concern remains regarding the effects of even  low-dose rate accumulating over time [17]. The three main sources of ionizing space radiation are galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), solar particle events (SPE), and the Van Allen radiation belt [18]. These exposures are exceedingly different from terrestrial sources of radiation with respect to the type, energy transfer, dose rate, and total dose. Ionizing GCR is composed of 98% nuclei and % electrons and positrons and con- stitutes  signi cant part of the total radiation dose [19].",

The three main sources of ionizing space radiation are galactic cosmic radiation (GCR), solar particle events (SPE), and the Van Allen radiation belt [18]. These exposures are exceedingly different from terrestrial sources of radiation with respect to the type, energy transfer, dose rate, and total dose. Ionizing GCR is composed of 98% nuclei and % electrons and positrons and con- stitutes  signi cant part of the total radiation dose [19]. The nuclear component itself is composed of hydrogen (87%; .., protons), helium (12%), and heavy metal nuclei (%; including lithium, carbon, oxygen, silicon, iron, etc.) [20]. These energetically charged particles are accelerated to relativistic speeds by intra-galactic supernovae [21]. During this process, the protons and heavy-metal ions are stripped of their orbital electrons. Thus, the role of personal and spacecraft shielding will be particularly important. Electrons and positrons do not pose  major biological hazard as spacecraft shielding is suf cient to stop these particles. However, the high-energy particles (HZEs, protons, and heavy ions) are energetic enough to penetrate the shielding materials used in spacecrafts [22]. Just as these particles penetrate spacecraft shields, they also penetrate the body, raising concerns regarding the long-term health effects of GCR exposure [23]. Linear Energy Transfer (LET) is the amount of energy  particle delivers along this penetrating path to the material it travels through [24]. The value of LET determines how the particles interact with cells. The LET value is also directly proportional to how deep the particle will be able to travel. Thus, high LET radiation particles reach deeper tissues than low LET radiation particles. For example, HZEs and protons generally have high LET values as they have high energy [13,25,26]. Therefore, they are highly penetrating. This makes them very damaging to biological tissue [27,28]. It is this high-density penetrating nature that allows for these particles to induce complex double-strand breaks [13,25]. Given these differences, the International Commission on Radiological Protection created weighting factors to relate different types of radiation to cancer mortality risks (Table ) [29]. While these weighting factors may be problematic for understanding radiation exposures in space,  conservative assumption is that  given dose of heavy ion irradiation, for example, may be at least 20 times as harmful as  given dose of - or gamma irradiation terrestrially. Table . Types of radiation and the radiation weighting factor. Type of Radiation Radiation Weighting Factor (WR) -rays/Gamma rays  Electrons  Protons   Neutrons  20 Heavy ions 20 Importantly, not only do these particles penetrate spacecraft shielding and bodily tissues, but they also interact with them, leading to the generation of secondary neutron radiation and reactive oxygen species, which can be just as, if not more, biologically harmful than the primary GCR particles. All of these details lead to  complex radiation environment onboard mission spacecraft, adding to the challenge of protecting astronauts from the ionizing effects of space radiation [23,30]. Of additional concern within the interplanetary radiation environment beyond the constant exposure to GCR is the relationship between solar cycles, solar wind, and solar particle events to the overall exposure [31]. Solar particle events (SPEs) occur when particles emitted from the sun are accelerated, either close to the sun or in interplanetary space. These particles consist of mainly 95% protons, electrons, HZE ions, and alpha particles [32]. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7465  of 31 However, unlike GCR, SPE radiation is of high  ux and low energy. Thus, spacecraft shielding is much more effective at blocking SPE radiation and most residual SPE radiation can be absorbed by super cial tissues. Skin doses of SPE are  10  higher than that of internal organs and are therefore more likely to cause skin lesions and hematological and immunological disturbances [19,23]. While SPEs can range in size, they rarely result in high total dose exposures. Furthermore, the exposure is different between the low Earth orbit (LEO) and beyond- LEO environment during interplanetary travel, which will also be different from that on the Mars surface. De ned as 80 2000 km above Earth  surface (and below the Van Allen Belts), the radiation environment in LEO is starkly different to that beyond LEO. The LEO is naturally shielded by Earth  atmosphere and magnetic  eld. Although there can be increases in solar radiation during rare large solar particle events and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), we are largely protected from the majority of GCR [28]. In comparison to the ~ mGy/year at sea level, estimates of around . mGy/day have been suggested to occur in deep space [30,33]. The projected dose received during  Mars mission ( months of travel each way and  years of surface stay) could therefore result in  total cumulative dose equivalent close to 1000 mGy [17]. More recently, with radiation dosimeter readings during the cruise phase of the Mars Curiosity mission, we can expect trans Earth Mars exposures up to . mGy/day [34]. Still, these can be subject to change based on local conditions and extreme events such as solar  ares. All of these unique features of space radiation make it very dif cult to extrapolate conclusions from terrestrial radiation research for hypothesizing risk pro les in the space environment. The majority of data are derived from human studies in which inadvertent exposures to high total dose or high-dose rate, short-duration exposures to gamma irra- diation that have occurred after nuclear events, or exposures in patients being treated for existing cancer with high-dose rate external beam radiation or internal gamma radiation (brachytherapy) or in non-human mammalian studies have been analyzed. However, the vast majority of animal studies use -ray and gamma irradiation, which are equivalent to GCR exposures. Moreover, -ray and gamma irradiation exposures predicted to be seen in space ight are not of clinical signi cance. Studies completed at Brookhaven National Laboratory, where researchers can simulate GCR by using  mix-beam of protons and heavy ions, provides  mechanism to study exposures in model mammalian systems. However, these studies are also limited to using  small number of high fractionated doses to achieve  desired total dose for exploration missions, because it would not be feasible to run daily low-dose rate exposures for long durations in order to replicate  -year Mars mission. In summary, to try and predict the risk of gynecologic cancer during or following space-  ight, we must understand that with the exception of true long-duration human space ight studies, our current knowledge is severely limited by the characteristics of the study. These characteristics include radiation type, energy transfer, dose rate/duration of exposure, total dose, animal model, presence of atmosphere, presence of magnetosphere, personal shielding, craft/dwelling shielding, and use of antioxidants or other countermeasures. . Effect of Space ight on Female Reproduction There is  paucity of evidence highlighting the effects of microgravity, space radiation, and space ight on the male and female reproductive systems, with signi cantly less for the female system based on the lack of women being exposed to GCR in the Apollo missions and past inequities. Most of our current knowledge on the female reproductive system stems from animal studies and are summarized in Figure . Notably, the past decade has witnessed  dramatic increase in the number of women living and working in space. NASA astronaut candidate class ratios of men to women have achieved parity since 2013, making it likely that the future of long-duration space ight may also feature equal numbers of men and women [16], thus warranting further study into how the cosmic environment affects reproductive health. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7465  of 31 Figure . summary of the effects of microgravity, space radiation, and space  ight on the female reproductive system. .. Microgravity Microgravity exposure poses multiple female reproductive health concerns. These include effects of weightlessness on gonadal function and fertility as well secondary space-  ight stressors, such as sleep disruption, that may degrade female reproductive health during and after space ight. However, the scienti  literature on reproductive changes in female astronauts during and after space ight or exposure to simulated microgravity (bedrest) remains sparse [10,16,35]. While female astronauts have successfully conceived and born children after space ight, detailed information on post-space ight fertility, preg- nancy complications, and birth outcomes in women is not available. Further, female astronauts tend to delay pregnancy, making it dif cult to separate the effects of space ight stressors from maternal aging on fertility and pregnancy outcomes. However, some animal studies attempting to understand reproductive outcomes in space ight have occurred, the  rst was in 1979 aboard an 18.-day COSMOS 1129 mission, where  barrier between the two male and  ve female rats was removed on day two of orbit to allow for mating. Upon return to Earth, no pregnancies were observed. However, no pregnancies were observed in the control group of rats maintained on Earth either. It is not clear whether the absence of pregnancy was due to an inability to copulate in the weightless space environment, or to secondary more complex endocrine and/or embryonic developmental causes, or even attributable to housing/caging concerns [35,36]. Studies of female mice that were maintained on the International Space Station (ISS) for 37 days prior to euthanasia in space (eliminating re-entry stressors) revealed evidence that these female mice could be detected at different stages of the estrous cycle post-mortem, suggesting that some females were likely exhibiting estrous cyclicity [37]. Mouse embryos  own on China  SJ-10 biosatellite completed  series of cell divisions leading to blastocoel morphology during space ight, but both the rate of blastocyst formation and blastocyst quality were impaired [38]. Severe DNA damage was observed in the embryonic cells, and the genome of the blastocysts developed in space was globally hypomethylated with  unique set of differentially methylated regions (DMRs). The authors suggest that these changes are similar to developmental defects, DNA damage, and epigenetic abnormalities that occur with exposure to ground-based low-dose radiation. However, given the dra- matic differences already noted between cosmic radiation and that of gamma irradiation that they used in their experiments, as well as to the inability to separate out the effects of microgravity from the impact of space radiation in these studies, much remains to be determined.

In 1994 and 1996, two jointly sponsored NASA-National Institutes of Health missions (NIH.R1) (STS-66) and NIH.R2 (STS-70) launched pregnant (gestational day  and 11, respectively) dams that were returned to Earth on gestational day 20 prior to parturition. Space- own pregnant rats gave birth at the expected time; however, they exhibited twice as many  lordosis  contractions during labor coupled with decreased uterine myometrial connexin 43 (gap junction) protein expression relative to controls, suggesting changes to the uterine smooth musculature tone with exposure to microgravity. However, the duration of labor, maternal weight gain, miscarriage/stillbirth rate, litter size, neonatal birthweight, placentophagia, and maternal care patterns were not signi cantly different from ground controls [40,41]. Importantly, NIH.R1 and R2 offspring were  own for the second half of the rats  gestational period, after organogenesis was complete, and returned to Earth for parturition. There have been no additional studies of mammalian pregnancy during space ight, and no mammal has yet given birth in space. Few studies have investigated rodent pregnancy utilizing terrestrial analogs for microgravity although past studies have exposed reproducing adult rodents to hypergravity produced via chronic acceleration [42 44]. This work provides strong evidence that, for some reproductive parameters such as pregnancy outcome and mammary gland metabolism, gravity load elicits  response continuum, and  single study compared responses to space ight and hypergravity. Analysis of mammary glands from G20 dams revealed  strong negative correlation between metabolic rate and gravity loads spanning , ., .75, and  . Approximately 98% of the variation in glucose oxidation and 94% of the variation in glucose incorporation into lipids was accounted for by differences in gravity  dose . These data demonstrate  remarkable continuum of response across the microgravity and hypergravity environments for this reproductive parameter. As reproductive factors such as age at  rst pregnancy, parity, and breastfeeding are all inversely linked with gynecologic and breast cancers terrestrially [45 47], more studies will be needed to explore any link between reproductive  tness after space ight and future risks of cancer occurring in these same organs. .. Hormonal Modalities in Space ight  unique operational consideration for premenopausal female astronauts is the use of hormonal contraception to suppress ovarian function, prevent pregnancy, and reduce menstrual  ow or induce amenorrhea during pre- ight training and space ight. With the pathway that astronauts follow to reach candidate selection and the mission training phase, female astronaut candidates often opt to use hormonal contraception through the phases of candidate selection and training, while awaiting mission selection, during mission- speci  training, and during the mission itself, potentially amounting to 11 or more years of reproductive suppression [48]. The combined oral contraceptive pill and levonorgestrel intrauterine device are the most commonly used hormonal contraceptive options. However, it is dif cult to predict how hormonal contraception use in combination with the complex deep space environmental exposure will affect female astronaut health as it relates to the intertwined nature of reproductive function on multiple organ systems. It is unknown how the environment of deep space, especially for long durations, will impact the shelf-life, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of the contraceptive agents as well as contraceptive ef cacy, menses/abnormal uterine bleeding, ovarian cysts/torsion, venous thromboembolism, cardiovascular health, musculoskeletal health during exploration-class missions, or indeed gynecological cancers. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7465  of 31 .. Space Radiation The likelihood of  signi cant acute exposure that would lead to acute radiation syndrome while  crew is in LEO is very low. However, the likelihood of an acute high- dose radiation exposure is higher for  crew traveling in interplanetary space in  minimally shielded spacecraft. As previously mentioned, SPEs of suf cient intensity to breach clinical thresholds during  trip to Mars have been recorded in the recent past. Tissue sensitivity depends on the cellular, extracellular, and stroma composition of the tissue. In general, tissues that have  large number of active stem cells are highly sensitive to radiation, whereas tissues with mainly terminally differentiated or with large amounts of supporting stroma and noncellular elements are relatively radioresistant. In females, the ovary is extremely radiosensitive. Radiation-induced cessation of hormone production can lead to temporary or permanent infertility. The vagina is similar to other mucous membranes in terms of radiosensitivity, but the vulva, labia, and clitoris are more radiosensitive. The uterus is radioresistant. Transient sterility can occur after doses as low as 1250 mGy, although most report the threshold dose for temporary sterility as being 1700 mGy [49]. The dose required for permanent sterility in women ranges from 3500 20,000 mGy (Table ), with lower doses needed for women older than 40 years [50,51]. Radiation damage to the female gonads is cumulative because gametogenesis essentially stops at the time of birth. Table . Radiation effects on female reproductive function. Age Dose, mGy Effect All ages 1700 Temporary sterility lasting   years 1250 1500 Amenorrhea in 50% 3200 6250 Permanent sterility Ages 15 40 1250 2500 Temporary amenorrhea 2500 5000 Ovulary suppression in 40 100% 5000 8000 Permanent ovulary suppression in 40 100% 8000 20,000 Permanent ovulary suppression in 100% . Effect of Space Travel on Cancer Carcinogenesis is the multi-step transformation of normal cells into malignant tumors, requiring the accumulation of several genetic and epigenetic aberrations. Cancer is charac- terized by the continuous proliferation of tumor cells, accompanied by resistance to cell death, induction of angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis [52]. DNA mutations altering protein-coding genes and signal transduction pathways are among the factors involved in cancer etiology. The protein-coding gene mutations involve tumor-suppressor genes, transmembrane proteins, platelet-derived growth factors, sex hormones, components of the insulin-like growth factor axis, transcription factors of the forkhead/winged helix-box transcription factor (Fox), and the SMAD families. Signal transduction pathways that are involved in carcinogenesis include sonic hedgehog (SHH), Wnt, and Notch []. There are also viruses like the human papillomavirus (HPV), Epstein  Barr virus, and Hepatitis  and , which are oncogenic [53]. Recent advances in the  eld of tumor biology are highlighting the role of the microenvironment and the altered stress response favoring overall survival [54]. There are multiple environmental factors, such as space radiation and microgravity, which can contribute to possibly increasing any risk of tumor development and the possible underlying cellular mechanisms associated with space ight [55]. In addition to the studies reviewed in Moreno-Villanueva and Wu [55], more investigations involving microgravity and radiation have been carried out, as shown in Table  [56 63] and Table  [64 73], respectively. Although ionizing radiation is  known carcinogen, irradiation with particles\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7465  of 31 in space differs quantitatively and qualitatively from  -radiation or -rays [30]. This limits our understanding of the risk of carcinogenesis, which may be possibly associated with space radiation. The biological effects of irradiation with heavy ions leading to DNA damage and repair, genomic instability, mutagenesis, chromosome aberrations, and neoplastic transformation have been documented [74]. Mouse models have generally been used for studying radiation-induced carcinogenesis, but these do not re ect the full range of complexity of cancer in humans [75]. Indeed, one main limitation for quantifying space-associated cancer risk is that there are no human data from extended exposure to space radiation, and in fact, estimation of carcinogenic risk for humans exposed to cosmic radiation is very dif cult to ascertain [76,77].

In addition, radiation effects ratio (RER) is  new metric that is being proposed, which compares the effects of two radiations at the same dose [78]. However, there are still important dilemmas regard-\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7465 11 of 31 ing cancer risk at low-dose rates [79,80]. Therefore, in order to improve the estimation of carcinogenesis risk of long-duration space travel, there needs to be more mechanistic analysis and biological insight of radiation quality effects and long-duration exposure to low radiation dose rates. The relationship between multiple space environmental factors that can in uence the development of cancer should be investigated separately and also in combination. To date, there have been  limited number of studies investigating the combined effect of space radiation and microgravity on cancer development. Recent  ndings suggest that the antiproliferative effect of simulated microgravity may lead to novel therapeutic strategies in combating cancer. In contrast, an impaired radiation-induced DNA damage re- sponse that can promote tumor initiation has been observed under microgravity conditions in vitro [55]. In studies using devices that simulate microgravity,  microgravity-associated increased radiosensitivity has been reported. However, there are currently minimal data re- garding the effect of space ight on the capacity of the cells to repair any arti cially induced DNA damage. Moreover, experiments investigating DNA damage response in simulated microgravity are not always concordant with those conducted in real microgravity [81]. Beyond the concerns of radiation-induced DNA damage, numerous molecular studies add to the hypothesis that individualized risk could be increased in the setting of micrograv- ity, as important signaling pathways commonly involved in carcinogenesis could also be dysregulated under microgravity conditions. One example includes the phosphoinositide- kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway [82 84], which is  key driver of metabolism, cell survival, and proliferation in response to growth factor stimulation [85]. Sex-speci  cancers (involving the breast, ovary, or uterus) together contribute heavily to overall cancer incidence and mortality in women. Breast cancer is the largest contributor to cancer incidence following terrestrial radiation and the three organs combined make up over 30% of the risk of exposure-induced cancer. Breast cancer is also the second largest contributor to cancer mortality following terrestrial radiation, and the three organs combined make up over 20% of the risk of exposure-induced death. Both ovarian and uterine cancers have -year survival rates of 49.% and 66.%, respectively. Colorectal, breast, prostate, and lung cancer cells have been studied in simulated microgravity in relation to the dysregulation of the PI3K pathway. In colorectal cancer cells exposed to simulated microgravity in  Rotational Cell Culture System-High Aspect Ratio Vessel (RCCS-HARV), Akt phosphorylation was found to decrease whilst PTEN expression and activity increased, leading to the induction of apoptosis [86]. Similarly, apoptosis rate was seen to increase in lung cancer cells exposed to simulated microgravity, as tumor- suppressor genes were upregulated when cells were cultured in  random-positioning machine (RPM), and AKT3 and PIK3CA expression remained unaltered. Interestingly,  study carried out on normal and cancerous breast cells found that the paradox between weightlessness-induced apoptosis and Akt upregulation under mi- crogravity conditions depends on whether the cells are adhered or detached. It has been concluded that survival strategies under this type of mechanical stress vary between cell types. They do in fact observe that apoptosis occurs in the cancerous cell line growing in  oating organoid-like structures after 72  due to major cytoskeletal rearrangements happening as  result of the simulated loss of gravity using an RPM [87]. These  ndings are supported by the study carried out on prostate cancer cells cultured in an RPM; Hybel et al. also reported that cells adhered to the culture  ask signi cantly upregulated genes of the PI3K pathway, such as Akt and mTOR, and  oating cells that formed multicellular spheroids downregulated these [88]. However, it remains unclear how accurately the different methods used to simulate microgravity re ect the results that would be observed in tissues under real microgravity, and how different equipment may affect experimental reproducibility, as con icting results have often been reported in the past [89]. There is no de nitive evidence of increased rates of carcinogenesis amongst astronauts exposed to space radiation in comparison to terrestrial controls (likely because of their overall excellent health pre- ight, low overall doses experienced to date, and very small\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7465 12 of 31 sample sizes) [90]. However, it is reasonable to assume that space radiation would increase an astronaut  individualized risk [30]. Furthermore, when reviewing astronaut and analog populations of aircrews exposed to cosmic radiation, Di Trolio et al. concluded that it was unclear whether increased exposure to cosmic radiation was directly linked to carcinogenic risk or whether the risk may be more attributable to lifestyle factors [91]. . Gynecological Cancers and Space .. Brief Overview on Gynecological Cancers Gynecological cancers (GCs) arise in the female reproductive organs and include tubo- ovarian, uterine/endometrial, cervical, vaginal, and vulvar cancers [92]. GCs pose  serious global health burden due to their high incidence among women of all ages [93]. There is  high mortality rate among women with GCs, which can be attributed to several factors including lack of screening, limited awareness of speci  symptoms, or even misdiagnosis. In advanced GCs, delayed diagnosis, together with limited treatment options, are major contributing factors leading to high mortality. In the case of rare GCs (for example gestational trophoblastic neoplasia, malignant germ-cell tumors, sex cord-stromal tumors, vaginal/vulvar carcinoma, etc.), these issues are even more problematic [94]. These tumors are generally associated with an overall poor prognosis. The low incidence of each of these rare tumors, with an annual incidence of < per 100,000 women, poses  major hurdle in the management of patients due to limited therapy options [93]. Considerable studies have shown that the occurrence and development of GCs are related to the inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes, the activation of oncogenes, and the activation of abnormal cell signaling pathways. In addition, epigenetic processes regulate gene expression through histone modi cation, DNA methylation, and noncoding RNA, thereby playing  central role in the occurrence and development of GCs [95]. Ovarian cancer (OC) is an umbrella term for  heterogeneous group of tumors that are very diverse behaviorally, morphologically, and molecularly. Up to 90% of OCs are of epithelial origin [96]. OC is commonly associated with alterations in BRCA1/ and TP53, both of which are linked with  poor prognosis [97 99]. Typically, the onset is insidious, with no speci  clinical symptoms in the early stage of the disease. To date, there is  paucity of sensitive and effective clinical screening tools for OC, with approximately 70% of cases being diagnosed at an advanced stage [100]. According to the American Cancer Society, in the United States alone, approximately 21,000 new cases of OC are diagnosed annually, accounting for % of all female malignancies, with  mortality rate of 62% and   ve-year survival rate of 20 30% [101]. Thus, there is an urgent need for highly sensitive and speci  diagnostic tools that identify OC at an earlier stage together with the development of new therapeutic approaches to improve patient survival rate. Worldwide, cervical cancer (CC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women [102]. Clinically, CC is associated with persistent infection with  high-risk  hu- man papillomaviruses (HPVs), particularly the subtypes HPV16 and HPV18 [103,104]. In addition,  number of other risk factors have been associated with CC, including early sexual activity [105], multiple sexual partners [106], other viral infections (such as HIV, herpes simplex virus type II), chlamydia infections [107], genetic factors (active onco- genes, including PIK3CA, ATAD2, and CRNDE; tumor-suppressor genes, including TP53, RASSF1A, and NOL7) [108], and tobacco use [109]. For the detection of pre-invasive cervical disease, Papanicolaou smears and liquid-based cytology were historically utilized as the main screening tests [110]; however, there is currently  shift in practice underway to- wards primary human papillomavirus (HPV) screening. Despite the continuous advances in treatment, including radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy together with surgery, early lymph node metastasis can still occur in  number of patients with CC, leading to poor prognosis. The  ve-year survival rate is still approximately 40% [111 114]. Although the HPV-associated carcinogenic pathway of CC is now well elucidated, further in-depth studies are necessary to aid in the discovery of novel molecular therapeutic targets that would contribute to the management of patients with advanced or recurrent CC. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7465 13 of 31 Endometrial cancer (EC) is another common type of gynecological tumor, compris- ing .% of worldwide cancer incidence and .% of mortality related to cancer [115,116]. Underlying risk factors are associated with high circulating levels of estrogen and include early menarche, obesity, diabetes mellitus, Lynch syndrome, nulliparity, late menopause, advanced age, breast cancer, tamoxifen therapy, and radiotherapy [117]. When consid- ering both biological and clinical parameters, gene mutations are being used for EC classi cation [118]. EC can be divided into endometrioid (Type ), affecting approximately 80% of patients, and non-endometrioid (Type II) in the rest of the patients [119,120]. Non- endometrioid ECs include clear-cell carcinoma, endometrial serous carcinoma, and car- cinosarcoma. Type  ECs have alterations in different genes, including CTNNB1, PTEN, KRAS, and DNA characterized by microsatellite instability (MSI) [121,122]. In contrast, Type  EC tumors are de ned as having TP53 mutations, ampli cation of HER2, increased CDH1 expression, and  high Ki-67 (MIB1) score, which is  marker of proliferation. The standard treatment is total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is usually effective for stage  disease [123]. However, in advanced stages, surgery is followed by radio- and/or chemotherapy. Despite advances in drugs and surgical treatments for EC, survival rates have not improved signi cantly.",

    "text": "Underlying risk factors are associated with high circulating levels of estrogen and include early menarche, obesity, diabetes mellitus, Lynch syndrome, nulliparity, late menopause, advanced age, breast cancer, tamoxifen therapy, and radiotherapy [117]. When consid- ering both biological and clinical parameters, gene mutations are being used for EC classi cation [118]. EC can be divided into endometrioid (Type ), affecting approximately 80% of patients, and non-endometrioid (Type II) in the rest of the patients [119,120]. Non- endometrioid ECs include clear-cell carcinoma, endometrial serous carcinoma, and car- cinosarcoma. Type  ECs have alterations in different genes, including CTNNB1, PTEN, KRAS, and DNA characterized by microsatellite instability (MSI) [121,122].

The standard treatment is total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, which is usually effective for stage  disease [123]. However, in advanced stages, surgery is followed by radio- and/or chemotherapy. Despite advances in drugs and surgical treatments for EC, survival rates have not improved signi cantly. Thus, improving the ability to identify the prognostic risk factors of EC and formulating reasonable new treatment plans are essential for improving the prognosis and survival rate of patients with EC [124]. Vaginal and vulvar cancers are rare malignancies with similar estimated incidence and mortality rates [125]. Due to the dif culty in performing large prospective randomized tri- als in patients with these rare tumors, systemic chemotherapeutic regimens have generally been extrapolated from experience in the management of CC. This is because these malig- nancies share similar epidemiologic risk factors, are strongly associated with HPV infection and are predominantly of the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) histologic subtype [126 128]. However, vaginal and vulvar cancers can be challenging to treat particularly when disease is not amenable to surgical resection or radiation [129]. There is currently no consensus on effective treatment as response rates to systemic chemotherapeutic regimens are variable in the recurrent setting for vaginal and vulvar SCC [129]. Additionally, given the tendency for vaginal and vulvar SCC to develop later in life, treatment options may be further limited by associated toxicity and co-morbidity [127,128]. Clinical and pathological prognostic factors are constantly being explored in order to minimize unnecessary treatments especially in elderly patients. Furthermore, new molecules are being investigated as targeted therapies to increase patient survival. Building on the previous knowledge about the individual and combined effects of radi- ation and microgravity on cancer and tumor cell processes [130], the relatively few studies on GCs in simulated space conditions that have been published to date will be described. .. Effects of Microgravity and Radiation on Gynecological Cancers: In Vitro and In Vivo Studies Microgravity has different effects on normal and cancer cells, but the related under- lying mechanisms are still being elucidated. Experiments using normal or cancer cells performed in space on the International Space Station (ISS) or under - -conditions using devices approved by ESA and NASA to create   conditions on Earth (known as ground- based facilities) [131], belong to  newly evolving area of research in oncobiology [132]. Numerous studies have demonstrated how  short- and long-term exposure to - and -  in uences differentiation, proliferation, migration, survival, apoptosis, adhesion, and other processes involved in carcinogenesis [53]. Space exploration missions also need to have strategies in order to mitigate the potentially harmful exposure to galactic cosmic radiation, which can cause cancer. Ongoing studies investigate these effects using cell- and animal-based studies in low Earth orbit [133]. The costs and logistic challenges involved when sending biological specimens to space have spearheaded the development of sur- rogate ground-based radiation experiments to study the mechanisms of biological injury and cancer risk. However, simulating galactic cosmic radiation has proven to be dif cult. In fact, current studies are only partially succeeding at replicating the complexity of this\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7465 14 of 31 radiation and its downstream injury pathways [133]. The following section discusses the few studies about various types of gynecological normal or cancer cells under conditions of weightlessness and/or real/simulated galactic cosmic radiation (Tables  and ). It is important to keep in mind that studies of cancer cells in culture do not necessarily re ect the actual tumor scenario in vivo. ... Ovarian Normal and Cancer Cells Exposed to Microgravity and/or Radiation Altered Gravity and Microgravity In order to study cellular interactions involved in the growth and differentiation of OC,  cell line, designated as LN1, was established from  mixed mullerian tumor of the ovary [134]. This cell line was cultured on microcarrier beads in the high aspect rotating-wall vessel (RWV), and the tumor cells readily proliferated without the need for cocultivation with  supportive cell layer. Phase contrast light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy showed the presence of three-dimensional multicellular aggregates consisting of multiple cell-coated beads bridged together, as well as scattered aggregates proliferating as spheroids free in suspension. This illustrates the ability of this culture system to provide the biological conditions necessary for pluripotent cell growth [134]. The same group later demonstrated that the RWV culture system is suitable for in vitro production of ovarian tumor cells with the same morphologic, oncogenic, and immunocy- tochemical characteristics shown in vivo [135]. In another study, LN1 cells were cultured for 14 days on the ISS during Expedition . When compared with ground controls, LN1 cells exposed to microgravity showed reduced expression of vimentin and epithelial membrane antigen [136], as well as reduced expres- sion of IL- and IL- [132]. Both of these cytokines are associated with the growth of several types of tumors, including OC. Przystupski et al. showed that exposure to microgravity affects the morphology of SKOV- cells, as well as drug ef ciency. Altered cell shape, pres- ence of membrane blebbing and lamellipodia, and lack of  lopodia have been observed in cells cultured on 3D-clinostat (3D-). After exposure on the 3D- with cisplatin, there was an increase in apoptotic cells and G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in comparison to the static control cells. Cell proliferation and migration were also altered after exposure to microgravity. These  ndings suggest that the altered gravity conditions affect cellular mechanisms that are involved in resistance to cisplatin. This is  crucial step towards understanding the relationship between cellular resistance to chemotherapy and the response to micrograv- ity [137]. An integrated set of systems biology tools and databases were collated together by Mukhopadhyay et al., who analyzed more than 8000 molecular pathways on published global gene expression datasets of human cells in microgravity. Interestingly, microgravity alone may induce several cancer related signatures, including OC [138]. Radiation In one particular experiment, six-week-old female B6C3F1 mice were exposed to 439 mGy heavy ion irradiation, as  290 MeV/ carbon-ion beam (LET 10 keV/micron) at  cm from the upper proximal point of  spread Bragg beam, and were autopsied 13. months after the irradiation [139]. The total tumor incidence was 32.% (mainly OC), in the irradiated group and % in the controls. These results indicate that heavy ion irradiation can induce ovarian tumors in females. The effects of heavy ion and -ray irradiation on tumorigenesis in B6C3F1 mice were investigated by exposure to 426 mGy heavy ion irradiation of 290 MeV/ carbon-ion beam (LET 60 210 KeV/micron) at the dose rate of 400 +/ 200 mGy/min, 500 mGy of -ray irradiation at 100 mGy/min, or 5000 mGy of -ray irradiation at 1000 mGy/min [140]. Interestingly, in the females after 13. months of whole-body irradiation, tumorigenicity was signi cantly lower for heavy ion than for 500 mGy and 5000 mGy -ray irradiation. The incidences of OC (which was the main tumor), were 73%, 17%, and 41%, respectively. These  ndings indicate that 426 mGy of heavy ion irradiation is associated with  lower risk of inducing cancer than 5000 mGy of -ray irradiation. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7465 15 of 31 In another experiment carried out to investigate the relationship between oocyte apoptosis and ovarian tumors induced by high and low LET radiations, C57BL/6N mice were exposed to 252Cf  ssion neutron (.13 MeV), 1000 mGy monoenergetic neutrons (.317, .525, and .026 MeV), or 137Cs -rays at  days of age [141]. The cumulative apoptotic index of oocytes was 65.%, 77.%, and 41.% for the .13 MeV neutron, .525 MeV neutron, and - rays, respectively. Follicles with apoptotic pregranulosa cells were 18.%, 53.%, and 22.% of cumulative index for the three groups, respectively. Granulosa cell tumors developed only in the -ray groups (.% for 1000 mGy and 15.% for 3000 mGy), whereas tubular adenomas developed in the groups of -ray (35.%) and monoenergetic neutrons (26.%). In addition, partial-body irradiation with 3000 mGy -rays to the ovaries induced granulosa cell tumors in 27.% of mice. These  ndings show that there is  higher effectiveness of neutrons than -rays to induce oocyte and pregranulosa cell apoptosis, which correlates with the inhibition of the development of granulosa cell tumor. Mishra et al. hypothesized that, in mice, charged iron particle irradiation induces ovarian carcinogenesis. Three-month-old female mice were exposed to  mGy (sham) or 500 mGy iron ions at the Brookhaven National laboratory and euthanized at 18 months. The 500 mGy irradiated mice showed signs of ovarian failure, with increased weight gain and lack of estrous cycling. total of % and 47% of mice irradiated with 500 mGy had bilateral and unilateral ovarian tumors, respectively, whereas 14% of mice in the  mGy group had unilateral tumors. The tumors were tubular adenomas or mixed tubular adenoma/granulosa cell tumors. Though conclusions are limited by the dose rate, this study demonstrated  that space radiation analog can induce ovarian tumors in mice, raising concerns about ovarian tumors as late sequelae of deep space travel in female astronauts [142]. ... Cervical Normal and Cancer Cells Exposed to Microgravity and/or Radiation Microgravity In  study investigating the multicellular interaction between CC cell lines and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which were grown in  RWV, it was found that the co-culture presented tubular structures penetrating the tumor cell masses. This co- culture formed aggregates larger in size than the monocultures, with increased cell mass and number. This suggests that  RWV provides  new model that can be used to investigate the regulatory factors that govern tumor angiogenesis [143]. Kelly et al. investigated various cell types, including melanoma cells, prostate cancer cells, osteosarcoma cells, lung cancer cells, and cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa) on the NASA-developed hydrofocusing bioreactor (HFB) and the rotary cell culture system (RCCS). It has been demonstrated that HFB exposure increased CD133-positive cell growth from various cell lines, when compared with the RCCS vessel and normal gravity control [144]. Space ight Studies So far, the majority of studies on space ight focus on normal cells and tissues. How- ever, little is known of the effects of space ight on cancer cells. To investigate the potential effects of the exposure of the space environment on cancer cells, one of the experiments included sending human cervical carcinoma CaSki cells on  Shen Zhou IV  space shuttle mission. The cell morphology and proliferation were investigated after  ying to ground. The growth of CaSki cells in the  ight group was slow when compared with ground groups. Light microscopy revealed differences in cell morphology between ground controls and  ight groups, with the latter being characterized by smaller, rounder, smoother and low ad- hesion cells. Furthermore, space-grown CaSki cells showed altered gene expression in genes regulating the cell cycle, cell morphology, signal transduction, and apoptosis [145,146]. Radiation In contrast to the numerous studies that have been conducted on the ground using particles generated in accelerators, investigations on DNA damage from direct exposure\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7465 16 of 31 to natural space radiation are very limited. In one study, where  xed human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells were  own in the Russian MIR space station for 40 days or on the Space Shuttle for  days, the resulting DNA damage levels, as measured by enzymatic incorporation of [ ]-dATP from terminal deoxyribo-nucleotidyl transferase, correlated with the space  ight duration.",

This suggests that the measured DNA damage was caused by space radiation and was dependent on the duration of the space  ight [71]. However, further experiments need to be performed in the true space environment in order to further investigate and address this critical question. Viral Reactivation  potential inducer of gynecological cancers during space travel may be linked to oncogenic virus reactivation. It has been reported that HPV is responsible for .% of CCs and 630,000 new cancer cases per year [147]. HPV can infect both genders and can also cause anal, penis, vagina, vulva, and oropharynx cancers. Despite immune clearance, some viral infections may persist in the latent phase and can cause reactivation or outbreaks. HPV virus latency and reactivation has been widely documented in literature [148], and this re- activation risk increases in women with co-infections, such as HIV and herpesviruses [149]. HPV and co-infection with HSV- have been reported in both cervical precancerous lesions and invasive CCs with  prevalence of 13 30% [149]. There is also evidence of the Epstein  Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus , as  cofactor in cervical pathologies. EBV has been detected in CIN and CC cells [149]. In 2017, Mehta et al. reported reactivation of latent EBV, varicella-zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus in  population of astronauts (male and female) as well as increased in viral copy numbers during long-duration space travel in comparison to short-duration space missions (10 to 16 days) [150]. During space ight, immune dysregulation, impaired NK cell function, and reduced  cell activation have all been reported [151,152]. Both short- and long-duration space ights can cause reactivation of the latent herpes virus infections [153]. In addition to the herpes virus, varicella zoster virus (VZV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), and EBV shedding increased in ISS missions [153]. Currently, it is unknown if space ight would alter the HPV clearance and/or reacti- vation. Based on the current evidence of immune dysfunction and reactivation of some viruses, HPV screening may need to be modi ed in the future, especially for longer du- ration space ights. Up to 23% of astronaut candidates had  history of treated or current cervical dysplasia. If research shows increased risk for reactivation of viruses like HPV in space ight, these women may be at increased risk for CC [154]. ... Endometrial Normal and Cancer Cells Exposed to Microgravity and/or Radiation Microgravity The possible effect of simulated microgravity (SM) on the process of proliferation and in vitro decidualization was investigated in primary human endometrial stromal cells (eSCs) (Cho et al.). Following 36  of exposure to SM, there was  decrease in the pro- liferation and migration of eSCs, without inducing apoptosis and changes in cell cycle progression. decrease in the phosphorylation of Akt and levels of matrix metallopro- teinase (MMP)- and FOXO3a were also observed, impeding autophagic  ux by reducing the levels of autophagy-related genes. Overall, these results suggest that exposure to SM decreases proliferation and migration in eSCs through Akt/MMP and FOXO3a/autophagic  ux [155]. three-dimensional (3D) cell culture model of human EC was established by Grun et al., using  RCCS and appeared histologically similar to the primary tumors. This is likely to be useful in the study of the molecular and biological mechanisms of endometrial tumor progression and especially when testing novel molecular targets for cancer therapy [156]. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7465 17 of 31 Radiation The effect of space radiation on expression of apoptosis-related genes was investigated in endometrial cells (HEC1B and AN3CA cells) by Palumbo et al., whereby cell death was induced by monoenergetic protons (1000 10,000 mGy; LET .35 keV/  and .86 MeV) and  -rays (200 1600 mGy) after irradiation for  . Following exposure to 1000 mGy protons and 400 mGy  -rays, HEC1B cells underwent apoptosis, as assessed by presence of PARP cleavage. However, this was not observed after higher doses, as cells were likely to have progressed directly to necrosis. AN3CA cells, which are less differentiated than HEC1B, did not undergo apoptosis, but underwent rapid necrosis following 10,000 mGy proton radiation and above 200 mGy  -radiation. Since the experiments included only three replicates per group, with no statistical analyses, it is still unclear whether there is greater potency of proton radiation compared to  -radiation for these endpoints in uterine carcinoma cells [157].

Current Challenges in Gynecological Cancer Risk Prediction for Space ight Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that female astronauts have an increased incidence of gynecological cancers. However, we should note that given the low num- ber of female astronauts, conducting studies to determine whether space ight increases gynecological cancer risk is dif cult. Another possibility could be that the current limita- tions enforced on the time females spend in space are effective at reducing the incidence of gynecology-speci  cancers. At present, studies focusing on subjects that experience similar occupational risk factors to astronauts is the closest form of data we can use to address cancer risk in female astronauts. For example, there are epidemiological studies that have found that there is an increased incidence of breast cancer in female commercial  ight attendants. Since female astronauts are exposed to similar occupational risk factors and may also have piloting experience, they may also be at an increased risk for breast cancer [15]. .. Gynecologic Medical Standards for Career and Private Astronauts The prevention of gynecologic morbidity in space begins with the selection process and continues with personalized preventive medicine programs during the astronaut  Earth-based career [158]. The medical selection criteria for female astronauts with different space agencies undertaking short- and long-term journeys in LEO are identical to those of males except for reproductive system standards and radiation exposure limits. Until 2022, career exposure limits for women of all ages were lower than those for men [14]. The difference in radiation exposure limits re ected the increased incidence of breast, thyroid, and OC in women compared to the incidence in men and the increased risk of lung cancer\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7465 19 of 31 among female atomic bomb survivors. Moreover, due to reduced cardiovascular and trauma risks, women live approximately   years longer than men, thus allowing for more time for post  ight radiation-induced carcinogenesis. However, the new radiation standard for the radiation exposure limit is now set to be less than 600 mGy and is universal for all ages and sexes. For example, the updated value has been fully integrated into the NASA Space Flight Human-System Standard on Crew Health that sets standards for  tness for duty, space permissible exposure limits, and permissible outcome limits, as well as levels of medical care, medical diagnosis, intervention, treatment and care, and countermeasures [159]. Gynecologic selection standards for astronauts have evolved and generally have been relaxed as space ight experiences progress [158]. Current medical standards allow for  history of endometriosis but would disqualify candidates with endometriosis that results in severe dysmenorrhea, endometriomas, or extensive pelvic adhesive diseases. Premenstrual syndrome must interfere with performance of duties to disqualify  female candidate during selection. Any gynecologic malignancy is disqualifying for selection and for  ight except for successfully treated cervical carcinoma in situ. As part of the  nal astronaut selection process, each female candidate  nalist undergoes pelvic and abdominal sonography, colposcopy, gynecologic examination, pap smear, and screening for high- risk HPV. Up to the 2013 selection, no female  nalists have been disquali ed because of gynecologic conditions found at the time of the selection examination.",

    "text": "For example, the updated value has been fully integrated into the NASA Space Flight Human-System Standard on Crew Health that sets standards for  tness for duty, space permissible exposure limits, and permissible outcome limits, as well as levels of medical care, medical diagnosis, intervention, treatment and care, and countermeasures [159]. Gynecologic selection standards for astronauts have evolved and generally have been relaxed as space ight experiences progress [158]. Current medical standards allow for  history of endometriosis but would disqualify candidates with endometriosis that results in severe dysmenorrhea, endometriomas, or extensive pelvic adhesive diseases. Premenstrual syndrome must interfere with performance of duties to disqualify  female candidate during selection. Any gynecologic malignancy is disqualifying for selection and for  ight except for successfully treated cervical carcinoma in situ. As part of the  nal astronaut selection process, each female candidate  nalist undergoes pelvic and abdominal sonography, colposcopy, gynecologic examination, pap smear, and screening for high- risk HPV. Up to the 2013 selection, no female  nalists have been disquali ed because of gynecologic conditions found at the time of the selection examination. However, several female astronaut  nalists were required to undergo surgical procedures or biopsies to rule out disqualifying pathology or neoplasia in ovarian masses, breast masses, or breast microcalci cations, or to remove large leiomyomata uteri [158]. For astronauts, the annual examination includes  physical test by   ight surgeon. Extensive blood analysis, periodic exercise capacity tests, mammography or breast MRI, and bone density analysis (every  years unless post ight). Colposcopy is performed based on current practice guidelines and known individual risk factors. During the examination, careful consideration is given to effective contraception for training and  ight, optimizing bone density, potential pregnancy timing, and desire for menstrual control during an upcoming mission. For astronauts over 35 years of age and experiencing spotting or breakthrough bleeding on cyclic or combined oral contraceptive,  saline infusion sonogram or hysteroscopy is usually completed to rule endometrial polyps, submucous myomas, or other abnormalities of the endometrial cavity. Pre ight medical evaluations are more comprehensive than annual exams and in- clude abdominal and pelvic ultrasound studies and breast MRI. Currently, all female astronauts receive  pre- ight transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS). While TVUS is not recom- mended for routine terrestrial OC screening, surgical management of ovarian masses can be considered [16]. Furthermore, if an endometrial stripe abnormality is noted on TVUS, terrestrial guidelines for endometrial hyperplasia/cancer screening can be considered, especially in the setting of abnormal uterine bleeding [160]. In addition to the CC screening recommended by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology (ASCCP), all astronauts should be encouraged to obtain the HPV vaccine series. Routine screening for  personal and family history of precancerous lesions and cancer is recommended to trigger consideration for pre ight genetic screening of hereditary cancer syndromes. Lastly, when discussing the risks and bene ts of hormonal modalities during space ight, counseling regarding the known effect on breast, ovarian, and EC should be part of this counseling. Astronauts in training that develop  disqualifying gynecologic condition are often granted  waiver if the medical threat or risk can be eliminated or reduced to an accepted level or the condition, so that it does not interfere with performance of duties or mission assurance. Decisions regarding waivers for  ight to the ISS are made on  case-by-case basis by NASA and the International Partners following  thorough review of the condition, inputs from specialist consultants, successful therapeutic intervention (if needed), and complete recovery. Final determination of medical certi cation currently rests with NASA and the Multilateral Space Medicine Board of the ISS International Partners (MSMBIP). For\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7465 20 of 31 the post ight female astronaut population, more conservative recommendations including annual mammography with adjunctive ultrasound for dense breast tissue, or alternating mammography with biennial breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), earlier and more frequent colon cancer screening (starting at 40  and every   thereafter), and an annual skin exam by dermatologist [154,158] have been recommended [161]. In the case of future female space ight participants on NASA-sponsored commercial crew orbital  ights (Boeing and SpaceX), Axiom missions, and Inspiration  missions, they will probably come under standards and medical selection testing that evolved from  previously published ISS Medical Evaluation Document Volume  and Appendix  [162]. The published standard  nds certain gynecologic conditions disqualifying, and individuals outside the standards can be assessed for  waiver based on  risk assessment/mitigation approach. Disqualifying conditions include: () disease, injury, or other disorders of the gynecologic tract that could require emergency treatment or interfere with mission com- pletion; () any disabling disorders of the reproductive system or associated anatomical structures that could potentially require emergency medical care; and/or () history of tumors or pathological growth will be reviewed by the MSMBIP. However, totally pri- vate space ight participants traveling to LEO or on suborbital  ights will have limited  ight-related responsibilities and come under the jurisdiction of the US Federal Aviation Administration and each company  medical policy. Proposed gynecology guidance for private space ight participants includes assessing the history of surgery, medication use, current pregnancy, recent postpartum state, or recent pregnancy loss status [158]. .. Countermeasures There are numerous protective measures speci  to ionizing space radiation expo- sure that could be considered, particularly for exploration-class missions. As discussed, space radiation remains one of the primary factors limiting human tolerance to long-term space ight. At present, one of the principal countermeasures to protect astronauts from the biological effects of space radiation is limiting the time spent in space. However, this is not feasible for long-term interplanetary space travel, so other remaining measures will have to be implemented. Preventing space radiation exposure through shielding remains  major challenge for space travel. Reasons for this include restrictions on cost, spacecraft mass, and the nature of ionizing particles, which can penetrate spacecraft hulls and result in secondary intra-vehicular radiation [19]. Spacecraft shielding can be divided into two main categories: passive shielding, constructed of speci  materials and always present on spacecraft, and active shielding, which utilizes magnetic or electrostatic  elds. In 2019, Barthel and Sarigul- Klijn reviewed shielding optimization methods for space travel beyond the in uence of the Earth  magnetic  elds [163]. Regarding passive shielding, optimization of shielding placement could help overcome the mass limitations of spacecraft. Furthermore, due to the interactions between the spacecraft and ionizing particles, materials with lighter nuclei atoms are ideal as high mass nuclei in shielding materials would increase the number of neutrons inside the spacecraft; an electron plasma would be most effective followed by liquid hydrogen. Special space suits with built-in shielding have also been proposed to eradicate the cost of shielding an entire spacecraft but to still provide reasonable protection to astronauts. Active shielding could provide protection, potentially without compromising the mass of spacecraft to the same degree. Electrostatic shielding would work by placing several charged spheres in speci  orientations around the spacecraft. This would create   safe zone  in  particular location on the spacecraft. Magnetic shielding would be created by using  superconducting solenoid around the spacecraft, generating  high magnetic  eld that would de ect particles below  certain energy threshold. The shielding technology described still has  long way to go in its development but holds the potential to provide effective protection to astronauts on exploration class missions. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7465 21 of 31 Biological countermeasures could also be utilized to protect against the ill-effects of ISR-induced oxidative stress. In 2021, Montesinos et al. discussed the role of these countermeasures, which will also be summarized here [164]. Several studies have found that dietary measure and supplementation is likely to have  protective effect in astronauts. It has long been known that  varied diet full of plant foods provides us with the nutrition needed for optimum health. The limitations of storage space and mass on spacecraft restricts the access of crew to  wide variety of foods that would provide them with an abundance of phytochemicals, antioxidants, and other compounds known to interfere with oxidative stress pathways. -Acetyl--Cysteine (NAC) contains an acetyl group that enhances its lipophilicity and allows for the molecule to cross the cell lipid bilayer. This contributes to replenishment of glutathione and thus may reduce both cellular ROS and mitochondrial damage. Because NAC tends to be more stable, it can be stored and administered in the form of  supplement to enhance cellular antioxidant capacity to combat the adverse effects of space environment exposure during space travels. DNA protection was observed in mice who received oral NAC treatment followed by  whole-body irradiation of 1000 mGy gamma radiation at  dose rate of 5000 mGy/min [165]. Treatment with NAC increased the overall health and quality of post ovulatory oocytes in vitro. Reduced spindle defects, decreased abnormal mitochondrial distribution, reduced reactive oxygen species, increased levels of intracellular ATP, and decreased abnormal cortical granules distribution were observed in oocytes treated with NAC [166]. However, more studies are needed to try to closely replicate space radiation to more accurately determine the effects of such radiation or the protective effects of countermeasures such as this. Selenium is amongst the group of micronutrients that is found to be depleted during long-duration space ight. This compound is needed for the normal function of oxidative stress protection molecules like glutathione peroxidase, thioredoxin reductase, and the selenoprotein family [167]. Selenium de ciency is also associated with dysfunction of the immune system [168]. Furthermore, taurine is  sulfur-containing amino acid also involved in mitochondrial health. Previous studies suggested that taurine conjugates with tRNALeu (UUR) or tRNALys (UUU) of mitochondria, which is important for proper codon- anticodon matching, thus increasing the accuracy and quality of mitochondrial proteins produced [169]. Supplementation of selenium, taurine, and other compounds that protect against oxidative stress might be important in lessening the ionizing effects of long-term radiation exposure on interplanetary space travel. However, many antioxidant compounds are typically needed in large doses in order to achieve the desired clinical effect as single agents. Unfortunately, the doses needed to achieve this exceed tolerability and/or safe levels. The use of  single agent may also downregulate other natural antioxidant pathways, given the complexity of these mechanisms in the human body [170]. Due to the limitations on the dietary intake of astronauts, the development of  single supplementation method that combines safe levels of the most effective chemopreventive compounds would be most desirable for long-term space ight missions. Better yet, developing  way for astronauts to grow their own fresh produce in space from which they can source their antioxidants and nutrients would be another desirable way of providing astronauts with compounds that are protective against oxidative stress and cancer development. Other studies have looked into several interesting biological methods like injecting tardigrade DNA [171] or neulasta, which is  bone marrow stimulant, into human tissue [172]. When injected in mini pigs, these were found to have  modest effect on the body  response to irradiation. With respect to women astronauts, hormonal contraception is already standard prac- tice, which may have countermeasure impacts. There are also non-contraceptive health bene ts of using hormonal contraceptives. Many considerations related to cancer risk have been examined on Earth. There are extensive data demonstrating combined oral contraceptive use protects against the development of colon, endometrial, and OC, with increasing protective effects with longer duration use [173]. Similarly, the levonorgestrel intrauterine device is associated with  reduced risk of EC and OC [173]. However, CC risk\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7465 22 of 31 has been found to increase with increasing duration of oral contraceptive use and newer combined hormonal contraceptive options of the vaginal ring and transdermal patch have  similar increased risk of CC [174,175]. Progestin-only contraceptive users do not have an increased relative risk of developing CC [175]. Furthermore, in HPV-positive women, it has been suggested that the estrogens and progestogens in hormonal contraception could enhance expression of HPV genes through hormone response elements on the viral genome, consequently increasing the risk of CC [176].",

Furthermore, in HPV-positive women, it has been suggested that the estrogens and progestogens in hormonal contraception could enhance expression of HPV genes through hormone response elements on the viral genome, consequently increasing the risk of CC [176]. Current combined oral contraceptive use is associated with  slightly higher risk of breast cancer (%); however, this appears to be more associated with triphasic oral contra- ceptive pills and decreases after discontinuation of oral contraceptives [177,178]. Current evidence also suggests that levonorgestrel intrauterine device users also have an increased risk of developing breast cancer, and this risk is increased with increasing age [178,179]. Overall, the bene ts of hormonal contraceptive use outweigh the slight increased risks of cancer development. This information is reassuring, however, as mentioned before, there is  lack of knowledge on hormonal contraception use for long-term space ight missions, and contraception use is still an important factor to account for in the overall reproductive health of female astronauts. The risk of breast cancer in female astronauts also merits further study, especially with relation to the exposure to space radiation. Additionally, proposed pharmacological measures include, but are not limited to, pharmaceutical radioprotectors and immunomodulation. Pharmaceutical radioprotectors are administered before exposure to  radiation environment. Radiation mitigators are administered after exposure but before the signs and symptoms of radiation exposure occur [180]. To date, the use of these agents thus far in controlled clinical scenarios, where radiation exposure can be controlled and quantitated, does not re ect the unpredictable radiation environment in space. Timing the administration of these agents would therefore be much harder in astronauts [164]. Immunomodulation-based agents include prospective DNA- and RNA-based anti-radiation vaccines in addition to anti-radiation antidotes. These would work via  group of antibodies and natural inhibitory proteins that prevent in ammation, pathological apoptosis, and necrosis of radiation-exposed tissues [164]. As discussed before, radiation has been shown to have molecular effects. These include genetic and epigenetic changes that alter molecular functioning and can lead to carcinogenesis [181]. Genetic counseling and screening guidelines are available through the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC), and the Society of Gynecologic Oncology (SGO), and it is reasonable to consider screening astronauts pre ight for genetic risk factors for certain cancers. Consideration may need to given for genetic screening, especially of female astronauts for certain mutations such as BRCA1/BRCA2 and others associated with breast cancer. If  carrier condition has been identi ed, screening and risk-reduction protocols can be discussed depending on the type of mutation. Terrestrially, risk-reduction surgeries depending on the mutation recommended at various ages. Salpingo-oophorectomy is recommended at age 35 40 years for BRCA1 carriers and at age 40 45 years for BRCA2 carriers. For BRIP1, RAD51C, and RAD51D carriers, it is recommended at age 45 50 years [182]. While work is ongoing in categorizing the radiosensitive/radioresistant genes, we should note that this may be an interesting application of gene/epigenetic modi cation technologies as radiation countermeasures. Recent advances in these methods have shown improved overall outcomes, where approaches altering the epigenome are readily re- versible [183,184]. Successful identi cation and modulation of these genes could allow for  signi cant reduction in negative outcomes experienced by future generations of astronauts. . Future Perspectives Omics approaches are likely to help in understanding the human health risks due to space ight missions. Since its inception in 2014, the NASA GeneLab data repository currently boasts over 271 omics data collected from space ight and ground simulation\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 7465 23 of 31 experiments, but it contains no data on female human gynecological cancers [185]. Inter- estingly, there exists only one dataset relevant to females, and the study only investigated the mammary gland of mice [186]. Therefore, there is  signi cant need for studies that investigate female physiology in space. There are  number of research opportunities that remain for considering the risks and management of breast and gynecologic cancers pre- and post ight. These include the following: histological differences of any tumors that have occurred in astronauts, char- acterizing molecular pathways involved in carcinogenesis in analog mammalian models, exploratory omics endpoints, the possibility HPV reactivation, the role of radiation coun- termeasures in prevention, optimizing in- ight or post ight screening protocols, changes in the microbiota of the reproductive tract during space ight and their relation to gyneco- logical cancers, and evaluating the role that arti cial intelligence and machine learning will play in cancer detection and prevention. Further study on gynecological cancers, including the incidence of the rare types, in space will build  knowledge base that will help to ensure the safety and health of female astronauts by giving them access to prevention, diagnosis, and countermeasures during their space missions. It would be extremely bene cial to the community to come with  roadmap of stud- ies that needs to be conducted so gynecological risks associated with exploration class missions to the Moon and Mars are minimized. Further, as commercial and private astro- nauts become more common, obtaining gynecologic and reproductive endpoints following space ight will be critical for the creation of pre ight, in- ight, and post ight proto- cols for the screening, diagnosis, and management of gynecologic morbidity and overall astronaut safety. . Conclusions The current data reveal  scarcity of knowledge about the impact of space radiation and microgravity on gynecologic cancer, as there have been insuf cient numbers of female astronauts exposed to long-duration, low-dose rate, and proton and heavy ion radiation to reliably determine the impact on the female reproductive system. With the upcoming Artemis missions set to place the  rst females on the Moon, there will be longer duration of exposures to both microgravity and space radiation; hence, the in uence of  ight length on risks related to gynecological cancers will demand  larger focus in ensuring astronaut safety during  ight and post ight. Indeed, among all body tissues, the male and female gonads are among the most sensitive to radiation. Therefore, these tissues may be one of the best to study to determine space radiation related exposures.

      "subject": "Outer space is an extremely hostile environment for human life, with ionizing radiation from galactic cosmic rays and microgravity posing the most significant hazards to the health of astronauts. Spaceflight has also been shown to have an impact on established cancer hallmarks, possibly increasing carcinogenic risk. Terrestrially, women have a higher incidence of radiation-induced cancers, largely driven by lung, thyroid, breast, and ovarian cancers, and therefore, historically, they have been permitted to spend significantly less time in space than men. In the present review, we focus on the effects of microgravity and radiation on the female reproductive system, particularly gynecological cancer. The aim is to provide a summary of the research that has been carried out related to the risk of gynecological cancer, highlighting what further studies are needed to pave the way for safer exploration class missions, as well as postflight screening and management of women astronauts following long-duration spaceflight.",

Costes, PhD3, 1Universities Space Research Association; 2KBRwyle; 3NASA 4NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA Abstract Omics data sharing is crucial to the biological research community, and the last decade or two has seen  huge rise in collaborative analysis systems, databases, and knowledge bases for omics and other systems biology data. We assessed the  FAIRness  of NASA  GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) along with four similar kinds of systems in the research omics data domain, using 14 FAIRness metrics. The range of overall FAIRness scores was -12 (out of 14), average 10., and standard deviation .. The range of Pass ratings for the metrics was 29-79%, Partial Pass - 21%, and Fail -50%. The systems we evaluated performed the best in the areas of data findability and accessibility, and worst in the area of data interoperability. Reusability of metadata, in particular, was frequently not well supported. We relate our experiences implementing semantic integration of omics data from some of the assessed systems for federated querying and retrieval functions, given their shortcomings in data interoperability. Finally, we propose two new principles that Big Data system developers, in particular, should consider for maximizing data accessibility. Introduction Over the last decade the vast increase in outputs from  omics  (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics) assays, together with decreasing assay and data storage costs, have resulted in an exponentially increasing volume of these  big  data. The high feature-number aspect of these big data has highlighted the importance of data sharing (or reuse) functions of these systems, as data sets often have relevance for investigating  very large number of hypotheses. Thus, developers of big data systems increasingly are focusing on the needs of users to discover, annotate, share, and analyze data. Omics data sharing is especially crucial to the biological research community, and the last decade or two has seen  huge rise in collaborative analysis systems -, databases -14, and knowledge bases15-17 for omics and other systems biology data. The FAIR18 principles are  set of guiding principles that are being advocated as foundational in the broad areas of data findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability. However, the challenges involved in using current technologies and real-world infrastructures within organizational guidelines to develop data repositories and/or data analytical systems that are  FAIR  are substantial. The FAIR principles deal with aspects of data handling such as identification, representation, and attribution. Metrics to evaluate the  FAIRness  of  data system or its design are also currently being developed19. System developers should consider familiarizing themselves with these metrics, as many of the FAIR principles can have significant implications in terms of feasible design options and operations resource planning. We assessed the  FAIRness  of NASA  GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS), along with four systems in the research omics data domain chosen for their similarity to the GLDS, using 14 FAIRness metrics. We relate these assessments in the context of discussion of the FAIRness concepts for the design of Big Data omics systems in particular, relating some of the challenges we faced developing the GLDS as  FAIR data system. In addition to designing  data system to be FAIR, developers of Big Data systems in particular should consider how system design can maximize data usability for its users. We propose two new design principles for FAIR systems that handle Big Data like omics data from our experiences developing the GLDS. By complying with these usability principles and the FAIR principles together, systems that manage Big Data can maximize both the usability and reusability of data. Methods NASA GeneLab GeneLab ( is  NASA initiative designed to accelerate  open science  biomedical research in support of the human exploration of space and the improvement of life on earth.20 GeneLab data have been used to research impacts of space on mice, humans, and plants. Phase  of GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS) project implemented an  omics  (genomics, transcriptomics proteomics, and metabolomics) data repository for biomedical\n\nresearch data conducted in or relevant to space environments (Figure ). This initial phase developed processes and systems for data submission, curation, indexing, search, and retrieval. In Phase II GeneLab implemented federated search and retrieval capabilities for data hosted by GeneLab and three other open-access, omics data systems, in order to facilitate data integration and biological meta-investigation (Figure 1a).21 (Note that these targets for search federation were selected independently and using different criteria than the data systems evaluated in this paper). Such meta-investigations are key to corroborating findings from different studies and/or kinds of bioassay data, and Figure . The GeneLab Data Systems (GLDS). () The GeneLab Data Repository. The federated search interface shown includes not only search of GLDS repository data, but of the extramural data sources Gene Expression Omnibus ( GEO ), PRoteomics IDEntifications repository ( EBI PRIDE ), and the Metagenomics Analysis server ( ANL MG-RAST ). () The GLDS Workspace. () GLDS Tools for omics data analysis (part of  Galaxy server1). translating them into systems biology knowledge and, eventually, therapeutics22. In Phase III, GeneLab has begun to deploy an omics data analysis platform as part of the GLDS. Using this platform, investigators can design, execute and share in silico experimentation of omics data sets (Figures 1b and 1c). At the end of Phase III, users with results of these kinds of experiments will be able to store them directly into the GLDS repository, linked to originating data and to the analysis workflows that generated them. Even though the inception of the GLDS predated publication of the FAIR principles, many of the concepts behind the principles were discussed extensively prior to its design. These discussions included substantial input from the National Academies of Sciences and  steering committee of outside experts in omics biological data, and had significant impacts on selection of technological approaches and system architectures, required resources for development and operations, and policies developed for operating the GLDS. In the absence of best practices from the community in certain areas of design and policy (Figure ), we wondered how we might assess the impact on FAIRness of the design and policy choices we faced, and how the GLDS would compare in FAIRness to other open- access, Big Data systems. FAIRness of Omics Data The FAIR principles were designed to guide the management of data so that it is maximally findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable. They are not precise prescriptions for FAIR system design specifications; rather they are aspirational guidelines with some references to exemplar standards and technologies. Among the findability principles are requirements that data be assigned  persistent, global unique identifier (GUID), be described by rich metadata, and be indexed by  system for retrieving the data. Accessibility requires the use of standardized, open (available for implementation to all) communications protocols for retrieval of data by GUID. Interoperability is supported through the use of machine-actionable metadata and data. Reusability requires systems to be compliant in the management of Figure . The FAIR principles18, and areas of design and operations of FAIR data systems (white boxes) for which best practices have yet to be defined.

Each of the authors assessed compliance of four open-access, omics data systems and the GLDS for FAIRness using the current working draft of the FAIRness metrics developed by the GO FAIR Metrics group23 (Table ). The four systems selected were the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), the Metagenomics Analysis Server (MG-RAST), and Metabolights. We chose the systems for their similarity to the GLDS; all are open-access, government-operated or government-funded, research lab-developed omics data systems. As the FAIR principles themselves are only aspirational, the assessment of the systems can only be at most semi- quantitative, and they would likely be affected by further clarifications or details in the principles and/or metrics which are almost certain to come. We rated systems with Pass when we had no evidence of any failure of  test by the metric. Systems were rated as Partial Pass, if the metric had multiple steps or components, and the system passed some, but not all; or if we had evidence that some data inputs for the metric yielded  pass, while others did not. We chose Fail only if we could find no evidence the system was compliant with any part of the metric, for any inputs we tried. Individually-assessed ratings were then combined into the consensus ratings shown in Table  through dialogue among the raters. Finally, we developed an overall FAIRness Score by assigning  score to each rating of  for each Pass, . for each Partial Pass, and  for each Fail and totaling these score for each system. Summary of FAIRness Assessments There is quite some variability in FAIRness among the omics data systems we assessed using the 14 metrics. The range of Pass ratings was 29-79% of metrics, Partial Pass -21%, and Fail -50%. The range of overall FAIRness Table . The FAIR principles, corresponding draft FAIRness metrics, and semi-quantitative FAIRness ratings for select omics data systems. Metrics were those developed by the GO FAIR Metrics23 group.

Findability The first findability principle, F1 (Table ), states that systems should identify data using globally unique and persistent identifiers; the FM-F1A metric focuses on identifier uniqueness, and FM-F1B on identifier persistence. The objective is to make data findable, but the implementation of F1 also supports data accessibility (FAIR principle A1). The qualifier  global  should be interpreted as global within the domain of conceivable use of the data. Thus, it is not sufficient to use locally (system-specific) controlled processes to manage data identifiers24, as this approach can never absolutely guarantee against overlap with other systems  local identifier schemes. In addition, F1 specifies the persistence of issued identifiers; identification systems that employ Uniform Resource Locators (which rely on alterable domain name resolution) cannot guarantee persistence of identifiers. Among the schemes for providing data identifiers, the most reliable over time are likely to be those that use third- party resolution (versus those that rely on in-house redirection). Third-party resolution identifiers include Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) and those provided by identifers.org, among others25. All but one of the systems we assessed passed the metric for F1 metric by employing persistent, globally unique identifiers with third party resolution. (MG- RAST only offers such identifiers as an option during data submission, and so was assessed as Partial Pass.) In the biomedical research and clinical practice realms, publishers have now widely selected the DOI scheme for identification and citation of literature; more than 80% of 2015 articles indexed by PubMed have assigned DOIs26. As  consequence, the biomedical community is already (and continues to become more and more) familiar with using these identifiers to retrieve and cite literature. Yet to date only  few omics data repositories have similarly implemented DOIs for data publications. Consequently, actual findability and accessibility of data in these repositories is less than optimal, even though they are technically in compliance with F1, and will continue to be so, unless and until the biomedical community is trained on how to use other identifying schemes for citing data. Furthermore, metadata from these repositories are not currently indexed in DOI meta-indexes (such as the one produced by DataCite27). In order to be compliant with F1 and A1, the GLDS is implementing methods to issue DOIs for all data publications. Additionally, curated metadata records of the publications are transmitted to DataCite27 for meta- indexing, increasing the chances for reuse of GLDS-hosted data. FAIR data also need to be described  with rich metadata  in order to be findable. The draft metric to assess F2 compliance merely requires  metadata description document that specifies  format for machine-readable metadata. The definition of the term  machine-readable  varies somewhat, but it is generally agreed that it cannot be natural language. (Although F2 refers to reusability principles requiring data  have  plurality of accurate and relevant attributes  (R1), the metric for F2 does not attempt to assess compliance with principle R1 [perhaps it should]). All the systems we assessed passed this metric. Furthermore, all systems passed F3, requiring association of metadata with data it describes. It should be noted that FM-F3 refers only to IRIs and not broadly to any other kinds of acceptable data identifiers; we assume that ultimately FM-F3 will be broadened to allow other kinds of F1-compliant data identifiers. Also, it is difficult to determine if any of the systems truly support IRIs, given that none of them currently appear to use non-ASCII character encodings in their data identifying schemes. The FAIRness metric FM-F4 is rather ill-defined currently. It requires submission of an identifier of FAIR data and its metadata to search engines (which precisely, it does not yet specify, but some common search engines are mentioned as examples in the comments for the metric). Pass should be given if the returned search results include links to the published data (again, it does not yet specify where in the returned results, although among both the top 10 and top 40 are mentioned in metric comments). Some of the systems we assessed failed this metric, and it seems their data records are likely not indexed by at least some search engines. For example, search of the MG-RAST data record identified by    or any of its tabular metadata yielded no search results referring to the repository using Google. More of the systems would fail this metric if it required data to be submitted specifically to DOI-based search systems (such as DataCite). Accessibility All of the systems for which we assessed compliance with FAIR principle A1. passed; all use open source communication protocols to access data, which are retrieved by their identifiers. FAIR Principle A1. stipulates that any protocol used to retrieve data  allows for an authentication and authorization procedure, where necessary. All the systems we assessed describe which functions of the system require credentials, and how to obtain the credentials. It should be noted that A1. can be applied to the design of all types of systems, from those with highly restricted\n\naccess controls, to the kinds of  open access  systems we assessed, that typically require minimal authentication and grant the widest possible access to all users. Furthermore, the data in question could be any kind of data, including raw instrument output, shared data analysis workflows or data products, or scientifically-relevant user comments and opinions. Even for open access systems, some systems functions such as user-workspace file management, user commenting and messaging, and user attribution of data always require authentication, because these functions must necessarily leverage user-specific information. specific challenge that GeneLab faced when implementing A1. for the GLDS was  diversity of credentialing services available to the system  target users, with no single service common to all users. Furthermore, the goal of GeneLab is to maximize access to GLDS data across all kinds of users, but within the bounds of authentication and credentialing policies of NASA   another challenge. Aside from policy restrictions, the development of any new credentialing and authentication functions or services can require considerable resources. solution for organizations that are seeking to develop open-access systems is to consider investing in development of an organization-wide integrated credentialing and authentication architecture (ICAA, Figure ), and policies for allowing users to leverage extramural credentials, with appropriate access limitations. ICAAs and attendant policies can provide flexibility to develop and/or deploy data systems with available resources that can meet policy requirements of the organization that support extramural user access. It should be noted that using an ICAA to leverage credentialing systems developed independently from the system requires ) technical compatibility between the authentication services of credentialing providers and the ICAA; and ) compatibility of the credentialing policies of credentialing organizations and those of the organization developing the data system. Technical compatibility is facilitated through the use of authentication protocols and standards. Organizational credentialing policy incompatibility is more problematic to resolve. For example, it may be that the organization deploying the data system requires credentials be updated at an interval that is different from that required by one or more extramural credential provider. If these differences cannot be resolved, the only option may be to limit access for some extramural users data system functions requiring authentication. NASA is developing an ICAA and adopting policies that permit certain intramural data systems to leverage it for user credentials and authentication. These policies stipulates that users within the organization must use the organization  own credentialing services, while extramural users may authenticate using one from  defined set of externally- managed credentialing systems (currently including authentication by selected  social media  systems, such as Google.com credentials). At NASA (and at most .. federal agencies), intramural credentialing is quite  long process involving corroboration of much identifying information. The use of the ICAA, users without NASA credentials can specify  minimum of information (.., only  verifiable email address), which they can provide easily through  web browser, and gain almost immediate access to the GLDS. Through use of the ICAA, the GLDS is able to recognize  lower level of confidence when authenticating extramural users, and implement appropriate access controls to some functions for these users (.., they may not join system administrator groups). It seems reasonable to suggest that an additional principle be considered when designing FAIR data systems that have at least some functions requiring authentication or authorization (A1.. in Table ). This principle, would stipulate that an integrated credentialing architecture, like that shown in Figure  be leveraged, in order to offer access to data to the widest number of users possible, when and where data policies permit such access. Most of the systems we assessed for FAIR compliance to A2 have some policy to retain at least some metadata when data are removed from the system. It is frequently unclear, however, which metadata were to be retained when data records are removed from the system. Data Figure . Use of an Integrated Credentialing and Authentication Architecture (ICAA) to comply with FAIR principle A1.. The ICAA provides services and policies that use information from intra- and extra- mural credentialing services to authenticate users of  data system. Organizational Boundary Extramural Credentialing Services Data System Integrated Credentialing & Authentication Service External Credentials Intramural Credentialing Services Authentication Services Organizational Credentials\n\nsystems should ensure that policies for retaining metadata are clearly stated, including which metadata and for what period of time. Another factor that specifically affects accessibility to Big Data is data transport. Data to be used as inputs in Big Data systems, but which are not located in the same environment as executable code of the system, commonly must first be transported (duplicated or moved) to the environment first. This environment typically is  user-specific workspace. The transport process for Big Data can require minutes, hours or even days in some Big Data systems, and represents  significant barrier to efficient access. Designers of Big Data would benefit from  principle that stipulates the collocation within Big Data systems of data and executable code (A3 in Table ). Interoperability I1 stipulates the  use  formal, accessible, etc. language for knowledge representation. The draft metric for this principle requires that the language for data or metadata be available by URL, and have  BNF representation. The comments on the metric suggest additional required language qualities, including that the language must have semantics ( [ vanilla ] xml and json ..should fail ). While current knowledge representation languages such as RDF and OWL28 are available to generate metadata specifications with inherent semantics, tools that leverage such languages require some sophistication in their use. All the repositories we assessed have metadata specifications that do not have inherent semantics, and thus would not yield  Pass for this metric. Metabolights and the GLDS both use the ISATab metadata specification, which can be converted to RDF, and so were rated with Partial Pass. The metric for principle I2 has  related requirement: that data systems use open, community-developed vocabularies for data and metadata, and that such vocabularies be more than simple keywords (.., include semantics in some form). As the ISATab specification supported ontological lookup from such vocabularies, we again only rated Metabolights and the GLDS with Partial Pass, and the rest of the systems as FAIL.",

As the ISATab specification supported ontological lookup from such vocabularies, we again only rated Metabolights and the GLDS with Partial Pass, and the rest of the systems as FAIL. In addition to lack of experience with knowledge representation technologies like RDF and OWL, another likely reason for lack of compliance of the systems with I1 and I2 is  general lack of available semantic resources developed by the community to generate metadata specifications and vocabularies, particularly in more recent domains like genomics, proteomics and metabolomics. We have ourselves sought such resources for use in the GLDS development, where we are seeking to provide users with omics data analysis capabilities, an omics  workbench  consisting of user- specific workspaces and data access controls, together with access to  suite of omics analysis tools (see Figure 1b and Figure 1c). Users of these tools will create data processing (analysis) workflows to transform input data into  higher-order  data products, which they will likely want to share with others and/or associate with the workflows and data inputs. One of the challenges we have observed for making these kinds of processed information FAIR include  lack of semantic resources for creating metadata specifications for such processed data and the processing workflows that generate them. While schemas like the Common Workflow Language29 (CWL) specification provide  method to represent and reproduce the mechanics of data processing, they lack domain-specific semantics regarding the nature of these data transformations (.., what are the goals of the transformation from  biological perspective? What are the biological data concepts produced in output files? how do these relate to input data elements? etc.). Without these descriptors, systems may not adequately index these processed data and workflows for discovery and retrieval. While sophisticated users (.., trained bioinformaticians) who do encounter processed data and workflows may be able to understand and reuse them, others without domain-specific experience and knowledge of omics data processing may not. challenge for the GLDS will be to help spur the creation of community resources so that it can implement rich metadata for processed omics data and workflows in  timely fashion. The objective of the metric for principle I3 is to measure how much data in one system are linked semantically to data in other systems. It is not surprising that none of the data sources link data  out  to data in external systems in semantically qualified ways; this is  challenging objective for any data system. (We ignored links to records that were merely duplicated between systems) Manual linking of data requires subject matter expertise and can be time- consuming for systems with many data records. Automated linking requires that source and linked data both be Table . Additional principles for optimizing data accessibility A1.. Authentication protocols should support multiple credential providers A3 Data transport should be minimized\n\ncharacterized semantically so that links may be inferred. As mentioned above, semantic resources for characterizing omics data are by and large still forthcoming. Reusability R1 is referred to by the findability FAIR principle F2 (see above); at this time there is no metric specifically for R1. R1. requires data systems to provide licenses for data usage (and is curiously intended to facilitate  legal interoperability  rather than reusability30. All the data repositories we assessed are governmental entities, and as such, licensing is traditionally prohibited. R1. and R1. require that data are published together with provenance metadata, and that data and metadata conform to community-derived standards, respectively. Such standards include taxonomies, ontologies and other vocabularies for metadata, and data and file formats. The metric for R1. involves the demonstration that  system can provide FAIR-compliant citational and contextual provenance metadata. While all the repositories provide such metadata, some do not use FAIR-compliant schemes for these metadata. Similarly, most of the repositories assess and validate submitted data files (but few validate metadata, as discussed above) against FAIR-schemes and formats. Discussion The systems we assessed for FAIRness clearly have shortcomings, particularly in the area of supporting data interoperability. None of the systems currently use  metadata representation language with sufficient semantics. In addition, none fully leverage FAIR vocabularies for metadata. There are perhaps several causes at work for these observations. There are often myriad vocabularies (ontologies) for metadata (each of which is  de facto community standard) even within  given biological sub-domain, and often much overlap in semantic content between them, creating the need for systems to be able to  normalize  input metadata across them somehow. For example, the concept of zero or very low-gravity experimental conditions appears in at least  different, widely-used biomedical vocabularies: SNOMED CT, MeSH, Read Codes Clinical Terms, Psychology Ontology, PLOS Thesaurus, and FAST Topical Facet, with varying language for the concept ( weightlessness  vs. zero gravity ). True semantic interoperability and data reusability that would permit  user to find all data tagged with this concept require either that all these concept instances be individually associated with the data, or use of  system that reliably maps all the concepts from these ever-changing, ever-expanding set of ontologies. Even if such metadata normalizing mechanisms are developed, their performance and value in generating  rich  metadata is dependent on the quality of input concepts supplied either by original data submitters or biodata curators (typically employed by the system). The expertise that submitters have is critical to shaping metadata that have value for many different kinds of audiences, and that allow associated data to be found and reused. In the biomedical field, submitters to shared data repositories have relatively low motivation to go to any great lengths to provide  rich metadata  (or assist biocurators in generating them). This is likely due, at least in part, to the fact that only  small fraction of shared data appears to be cited in publication references when they are reused.31 Without their input, niche repositories and data systems, like the GLDS, with limited resources for acquiring (and maintaining) rich metadata that meet all the criteria above must constantly trade the use of resources to acquire or generate rich metadata with those that could be used for other worthy goals. The findability and interoperability principles, when implemented in data systems, support data integration functions like multi-source data querying and retrieval. Principles F2, I1, I2, and R1. require the use of community-developed metadata standards, formal languages for metadata representation, FAIR vocabularies, and qualified references to other data. These principles are unfortunately not yet widely or fully implemented across biomedical data systems, making it difficult for systems to develop functions that integrate data semantically. To illustrate this, we examine our own experience developing the GLDS to provide federated search and retrieval of omics data from several data sources. We sought to import metadata records from three open-access data systems into our own metadata warehouse: GEO, MG-RAST, and the PRoteomics IDEntifications repository (PRIDE). Each of these systems defines metadata for omics data sets differently, but none of them make these schemas available in  formal semantic language format (such as RDF or OWL). Furthermore, there are no existing maps of any of the metadata schemas to each other. As such, we resorted to manually creating semantic maps of these schemas for use in our system; queries generated via the GLDS or its RESTful search API are executed against the mapped schema concepts, and matching records are shown in  common object model representation (Figure ). While this approach met our immediate goals of allowing users to query several data sources using our system, it required  good deal of resources and domain expertise to develop  schema mapping. Furthermore, maintaining this mapping over time as each of the data sources inevitably change will require more of our limited resources. The research community should recognize the value of federated system functions like the querying function that the GLDS offers, and urge all open access repositories and data systems to make their metadata schemas available to all according to the aforementioned FAIR principles.

In this paper, we strongly advocate for translational research at NASA, provide recent examples of NASA sponsored early-stage translational research, and discuss options for  path forward. Our overall objective is to help in stimulating  collaborative research across multiple disciplines and entities that, working together, will more effectively and more rapidly achieve NASA  goals for human space ight. npj Microgravity (2017) : ; doi:10.1038/s41526-016-0002- INTRODUCTION With the International Space Station (ISS) available for research and habitation for the next decade, there is now  precious opportunity to signi cantly advance the contributions of space life sciences and space medicine toward enabling the Exploration Class missions (that is, human missions beyond low-Earth orbit). Such missions are currently burdened with signi cant anticipated crew health and safety challenges. Coordinated research and development are crucial for producing effective countermeasures against the deleterious in uences of space ight on the human body. To this end, we emphatically support the development of translational research efforts at NASA that will facilitate bi- directional information  ow between basic and applied life sciences and medical operations with the goal to accelerate countermeasure development. As identi ed by National Academy committees and embedded in the NASA Strategic Plan,  sustainable human space ight program requires robust research at both basic and applied levels to make fundamental biological discoveries and to address the known and emerging risks to human health resulting from the space ight environment, respectively. The Life Sciences portfo- lio at NASA is composed of the Space Biology program ( basic science program), the Human Research Program (HRP, an applied program), and Medical Operations (Of ce of Chief Health and Medical Of cer). Informal translational research within these programs has taken place at NASA for decades, yet there is  need for  more coordinated effort that enables dynamic translation that can take rapid advantage of new  ndings. In particular, the National Academy committees recommended that NASA follows key elements of the National Institutes of Health  (NIH) model of translational science., It was speci cally recommended that the coordination and maturation of projects between each level of research be enhanced to increase knowl- edge transfer and identi cation of potential solutions for astronaut health challenges. Additionally, the translation of knowledge to Earth-based medical care has recently begun with the designation of the ISS as  National Laboratory (currently through the Center for the Advancement of Science in Space). In this paper, we provide context for the current drivers (and needs) for translational research at NASA, brie  summarize the experience at NIH, and lay out  two-phased approach for translational research. As illustrated in Fig. , the  rst phase is basic-to-applied and the second phase is applied-to-operational. We de ne the levels of the research continuum as follows, consistent with the Decadal Survey  Interim Report: basic research aims to generate new biological knowledge using biological systems or model organisms, applied research aims to develop countermeasures for risks to astronaut health (similar to pre-clinical research), and medical operations puts countermea- sures into practice for astronauts (like operations in the clinic). Finally, going into greater depth on the basic-to-applied window of translation, we provide examples and recommendations of early-stage research where Space Biology and HRP aim to build synergy between their existing programs. NASA  Space Biology and HRP entities have recently spearheaded communications both internally and externally to coordinate the Agency  translational research efforts between basic and applied levels. In this paper, we strongly advocate for translational research at NASA, provide recent examples of NASA-sponsored early-stage translational research, and discuss options for  path forward.

NASA  INVOLVEMENT IN TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH De nitions For the purposes of this paper we will focus mainly on the translation of space life sciences research knowledge to the human challenges associated with long-duration space ights. Our narrow translational research focus is therefore de ned as the application of basic science discoveries to the development of new preventive and therapeutic approaches supporting optimized human adaptation to space missions with extended durations and distances from Earth. NASA  human space ight challenges The biomedical concerns and risks of human Exploration Class missions, characterized by extended duration space exposures and travel far beyond Earth, are not yet fully understood. Prior to an exploration mission, better de nition of these risks, and the development and implementation of countermeasures must be achieved to avoid physiological and behavioral changes that could degrade the health, safety and productivity of crew members during extended ISS habitation and missions beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Additionally, during exploration missions, tools are needed to monitor and manage individual and crew resiliency in the face of unplanned challenges. The ISS presently accommodates continuous human habitation, enabling basic and applied research and testing of new ways to thrive in space. ISS offers  unique platform that is facilitating the identi cation of requirements for conducting future human missions that could last for years, and the challenges associated with orbiting and even occupying other planets. Exploration Class missions beyond ISS will require detailed knowledge of what adaptations can be tolerated and those which must be countered for the long-term. These missions will also require  degree of operational resiliency and autonomy never before attempted. Human space exploration is now at  crossroads, and leaving LEO will place increasing demands on space life sciences research to support such endeavors. Key space ight-related environmental factors that chronically impact human health and performance during such missions are: microgravity, con nement, and exposure to space radiation. We chose just four examples, pro led below, to demonstrate the value of translational research in addressing four speci  risks identi ed by NASA for astronaut health and safety: immune response, microbe-host interactions, oxidative stress and damage, and visual impairment (VI) syndrome. There are many others on NASA  list,10 of course, including some in broad areas such as nutrition and sleep, and surely some not yet identi ed. For NASA, translational research has historically been11 and is increasingly viewed as essential to better de ne and minimize these health risks. Translational research: pioneered by NIH NIH has pioneered the translational research challenge since about 2003. Several NIH institutes have been established under the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences6 to develop   Translational Pipeline  linking basic research to pre- clinical and clinical investigations7,12 that will lead to eventual utilization in the provision of health care. Both the NIH and NASA research portfolios cover  broad range of spatial scale and complexity, including microbiology, cell culture, model organisms, and an array of human biomedical studies (Fig. ). NASA can learn much from NIH  endeavors, and the implementation of cooperative agreements between these agencies could provide effective bridges for knowledge sharing. Recent NASA drivers toward translational research In 2009, after consultation with NASA, Congress determined that an objective reassessment was needed of the basic and applied research capabilities and resources available to support future human space exploration. Congress mandated that the National Research Council conduct and publish   Decadal Survey  ultimately titled Recapturing  Future for Space Exploration: Life and Physical Sciences Research for  New Era. The Decadal Survey reviewed the research, development, and applications relevant to basic science and human space exploration. The Space Life and Physical Sciences research communities provided major input to the Decadal Survey and helped to shape its many broad Fig. The NASA Life Sciences Translational Path. It moves from basic research to human exploration applications with bi-directionality options. As knowledge is applied along this path (top arrows) questions may arise that can best be addressed by more basic research (bottom arrows) in order to support further progress toward successful human exploration Life sciences translational research at NASA JS Alwood et al  npj Microgravity (2017)  Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA\n\nrecommendations. key recommendation was to increase the integration of efforts toward conduct of cross-disciplinary, focused translational research and development with applications to human space risks and related areas supporting human space exploration. Another main recommendation was for NASA to constitute an integrated organization within NASA to manage these efforts. In 2011, the Space Life and Physical Science Research & Applications Division was established within NASA  Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. Key life science elements within the SLPSRA Division include the HRP and the Space Biology program (Fig. ). HRP created and maintains  dynamic Human Research Roadmap that de nes known risks, mitigation capabilities, current knowledge gaps, and concepts for future work regarding astronaut health, performance, and safety.10 In contrast, Space Biology focuses on de ning the changes in basic biological mechanisms as  result of space ight and has developed  set of Guiding Questions that de ne its research program.13 Despite the programmatic differences, there are overlapping research areas within these two programs at the basic-to-applied phase of translation, which are itemized in Fig. and described below in the Examples section. The Decadal Survey panels made recommendations for research priorities throughout the lifespan of the ISS. In Chapter  of the Decadal Survey, the Animal and Human Biology panel () made 16 key recommendations spanning multiple systems in the body of vertebrates for conduct of basic and applied research (Table ). The panel indicated that many of these should be studied using  translational framework. Further, the panel unanimously stated that animal research be  rmly integrated in the space life sciences portfolio both within space-based and ground-based programs to drive the translation of knowledge. Additionally, in Chapter  of the Decadal Survey, the Integrative and Translational Research for the Human Systems panel () made 11 recommendations related to crosscutting issues (CC) for humans in the space environment (Table ). One goal of this paper is to bring stakeholders .. taxpayers, Congress, the National Academies, and relevant science communities up to date regarding NASA  progress in building collaborative research communities in the translational area to pursue these important recommendations. NASA  CURRENT TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH APPROACH Several recent NASA-sponsored activities demonstrate an increased Agency commitment to two phases of translation (Fig. ). Within the basic-to-applied phase,  collaborative work- shop was held by NASA JSC and ARC in 2004 that addressed  Animal Research in Support of Human Space Exploration  before the translational research terminology was commonly used.14 Further, several recent events have been held to systematically advance NASA  translational research discussions within the basic and applied space life sciences communities, including: an Arti cial Gravity Workshop (responsive to the recommendations AH9-10 in Table  and CC2 in Table );15 symposia at the American Society for Gravitational Space Research (ASGSR) annual meetings in 201416and 2015;17 and the annual HRP Investigators Workshops in 2015 and 2016. Finally, an internal analysis of the Space Biology and HRP research plans has pointed to areas, described in the examples section below and in Fig. , that are ripe for synergism. Within the applied-to-operational phase, HRP established  Translational Research Institute, in October 2016, with  key goal to recruit funded, terrestrial biomedical research entities in furthering NASA translational research goals,18 20 and to help mature countermeasures and technologies for use in medical operations.",

But how can translational research most effectively be pursued using existing resources? Team science is one solution21 and has been used successfully by NASA in the past. Additionally, enhanced institutional coordination within NASA and between federal funding agencies, as well as relevant non-governmental organizations, is needed to spur translation. systematic approach to identify collaborative translational opportunities, for example by text analytics,22 would have bene ts for investigators Fig. Space Biology and Human Research Bi-directional Synergism.

Animal and human biology (AH) research recommendations for humans in the space environment identi ed in chapter  of the decadal survey () Identi er Recommendation AH1 The ef cacy of bisphosphonates should be tested in an adequate population of astronauts on the ISS during  -month mission. AH2 The preservation/reversibility of bone structure/strength should be evaluated when assessing countermeasures. AH3 Bone loss studies of genetically altered mice exposed to weightlessness are strongly recommended. AH4 New osteoporosis drugs under clinical development should be tested in animal models of weightlessness. AH5 Conduct studies to identify underlying mechanisms regulating net skeletal muscle protein balance and protein turnover during states of unloading and recovery. AH6 Conduct studies to develop and test new prototype exercise devices and to optimize physical activity paradigms/prescriptions targeting multisystem countermeasures. AH7 Determine the daily levels and pattern of recruitment of  exor and extensor muscles of the neck, trunk, arms, and legs at   and after being in  novel gravitational environment for up to  months. AH8 Determine the basic mechanisms, adaptations, and clinical signi cance of changes in regional vascular/interstitial pressures (starling forces) during long-duration space missions. AH9 Investigate the effects of prolonged periods of microgravity and partial gravity (/ or / ) on the determinants of task-speci , enabling levels of work capacity. AH10 Determine the integrative mechanisms of orthostatic intolerance after restoration of gravitational gradients (both  and / ). AH11 Collaborative studies among  ight medicine and cardiovascular epidemiologists are recommended to determine the best screening strategies to avoid  ying astronauts with subclinical coronary heart disease that could become manifest during  long-duration exploration-class mission ( years). AH12 Determine the amount and site of the deposition of aerosols of different sizes in the lungs of humans and animals in microgravity. AH13 Multiple parameters of  cell activation in cells should be obtained from astronauts before and after re-entry to establish which parameters are altered during  ight. AH14 Both to address the mechanism() of the changes in the immune system and to develop measures to limit the changes, data from multiple organ/system-based studies need to be integrated. AH15 Perform mouse studies of immunization and challenge on the ISS, using immune samples acquired both prior to and immediately upon re-entry, to establish the biological relevance of the changes observed in the immune system. Parameters examined need to be aligned with those in humans in uenced by  ight. AH16 Studies should be conducted on transmission across generations of structural and functional changes induced by exposure to space during development. Ground-based studies should be conducted to develop specialized habitats to support reproducing and developing rodents in space.

Life sciences translational research at NASA JS Alwood et al  npj Microgravity (2017)  Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA\n\nas well as NASA program managers. Text analytics is one method to systematically and automatically examine published papers for linkages based on common concepts (manifest in authorship, keywords, references, methods). This approach would allow the visualization of domains where research has been explored jointly within animals and humans or where the gaps in knowledge reside. The Decadal Survey () provides guidance on how to structure  fully-integrated translational program by partitioning the life sciences research portfolio into two dimensions. Horizontal integration of projects is the  rst dimension and requires multidisciplinary approaches to solve complex problems, often within  given organism type. The second dimension, vertical translation, requires meaningful interactions among basic, applied, and operational scientists to translate fundamental discoveries to human treatments, such as using cell biology and model organism research to address human problems, for example in immune system response challenges. The NIH experience has shown that the horizontal integration of research knowledge is essential for developing  comprehensive understanding of physiology and to effectively solve health problems.23 NASA has  successful record in this domain that should continue, for example, with its BioSpecimen Sharing Programs. Researchers have recently shared tissues from speci  animals on  late Shuttle mission (STS-131),24 31 and the most recent Russian Bion biosatellite mission;32 35 sharing was in the form of preserved tissues from NASA  Life Sciences Data Archive.36 Further, new Omic-science studies like NASA  emer- ging GeneLab open-science data and biosample repository37 and the recent astronaut Twins Study38 enable big-data collection, analytics, and horizontal integration. Finally, restoring the gravity vector arti cially via chronic whole-body centrifugation may solve issues in multiple tissues, simultaneously. In contrast, vertical translation requires that investigators along the research continuum from basic to operational (Fig. ) interact regularly to share ideas. Examples of vertical translation at NASA are in the recent International Life Sciences Research Announce- ment awards (NASA, European, Japanese, and Canadian space program research solicitations),39 GeneLab,37 and the recent call for proposals in the area of arti cial gravity (AG).40 All of these planned research projects span multiple levels of the translational pipeline. Additionally, vertically-integrated team science occurs through NASA Specialized Centers of Research (NSCOR)41 44 and the National Space Biomedical Research Institute  centers for radiation research,45 47 which aim to identify and translate countermeasure candidates for radiation-induced insults (Table : CC7 CC9). There is surely untapped value to be derived from additional vertical translation within NASA programs. Some existing overlap and synergism between HRP and Space Biology goals and approaches amenable to both horizontal and vertical translation are shown in Fig. . Informally, vertical translation has occurred at NASA for many years11 with  conceptual maturation path shown in Fig. . For example, molecular mechanisms underlying the bone loss resulting from musculoskeletal disuse have been demonstrated in ground-based models,48 50 responding to recommendations AH2- (Table ). Further, two precursors to osteoporosis drugs have been tested in space- own or ground-based mice and shown to be effective at preventing weightlessness-induced bone loss,49 51 responsive to recommendations AH2, AH4 (Table ). Thus, these drugs give HRP and Medical Operations additional potential countermeasures besides exercise52 and Alendronate53 to combat bone loss during space ight. Additional speci  examples of vertical translation are described in the examples below. Table . Crosscutting Issues (CC) for Humans in the Space Environment identi ed in Chapter  of the Decadal Survey () Identi er Recommendation CC1 To ensure the safety of future commercial orbital and exploration crews, quantify post-landing vertigo and orthostatic intolerance in  suf ciently large sample of returning ISS crews, as part of the immediate post- ight medical exam. CC2 Determine whether AG is needed as  multisystem countermeasure and whether continuous large radius AG is needed or intermittent exercise within lower-body negative pressure or short-radius AG is suf cient. Human studies in ground laboratories are essential to establish dose-response relationships, and what gravity level, gradient, rotations per minute, duration, and frequency are adequate. CC3 Conduct studies on humans to determine whether there is an effect of gravity on micronucleation and/or intrapulmonary shunting or whether the unexpectedly low prevalence of decompression sickness on the space shuttle/ISS is due to underreporting. Conduct studies to determine operationally acceptable low suit pressure and hypobaric hypoxia limits. CC4 Determine optimal dietary strategies for crews and food preservation strategies that will maintain bioavailability for 12 or more months. CC5 Initiate  robust food science program focused on preserving nutrient stability for  or more years. CC6 Include food and energy intake as an outcome variable in dietary intervention trials in humans. CC7 Conduct longitudinal studies of astronauts for cataract incidence, quality, and pathology related to radiation exposures to understand both cataract risk and radiation-induced late tissue toxicities in humans. CC8 Expand the use of animal studies to assess space radiation risks to humans from cancer, cataracts, cardiovascular disease, neurologic dysfunction, degenerative diseases, and acute toxicities such as fever, nausea, bone marrow suppression, and others. CC9 Continue ground-based cellular studies to develop end points and markers for acute and late radiation toxicities, using radiation facilities that are able to mimic space radiation exposures. CC10 Expand understanding of gender differences in adaptation to the space ight environment through  ight- and ground-based research, particularly potential differences in bone, muscle, and cardiovascular function and longterm radiation risks. CC11 Investigate the biophysical principles of thermal balance to determine whether microgravity reduces the threshold for thermal intolerance.

The speci  causes are not yet clear, but are likely linked to one or more of the following factors: physiological stress, circadian rhythm disruption, microgravity exposure, isolation, altered nutrition, or radiation exposure.57 Further, the space ight environment compounds crew health risks as some microorganisms become more virulent (see below) and resistant to antibiotic drugs. Even though the reactivation of latent viruses has been well documented in crewmembers,58 it is still unclear if the compro- mised immune response can lead to increased susceptibility to disease. There is not  suf ciently accurate ground-based analog to study immune suppression from space ight. However, extreme occupational environments such as Antarctica winter-over and the Aquarius undersea station enable aspects of immune dysregula- tion to be studied under similar stressors. Additionally, many valuable analog studies with animals and cells have been conducted, including unloading of rodents,59 and cell cultures and bioreactors.56,60 These studies have investigated immune response mechanisms and can allow the use of controlled diets, increased radiation levels and other factors that are not possible in human research. Microbe-host interactions Preventive measures limit the presence of many medically signi cant microorganisms during space ight missions, but microbial infection of crewmembers cannot be completely prevented. Space ight experiments have demonstrated unique and heterogeneous microbial responses in space ight ecosystems and cultures,61,62 although the mechanisms behind those responses and their operational relevance remain unclear. In 2007, the operational importance of these microbial responses increased, as the results of Space Biology experiments aboard STS-115 and STS-123 demonstrated that an enteric pathogen (Salmonella typhimurium) increased in virulence in  mouse model of infection,63,64 responding to recommendation AH15 (Table ). These studies can improve our understanding of the potential consequences to astronauts of elevated microbial virulence during long-duration missions. Evidence for increased microbial virulence has recently been collected and reported from both space ight-analog systems and actual space ight.61,65,66 Although the conduct of virulence studies during space ight is challenging and often impractical in humans, data are being collected as part of the ISS Microbial Observatory,62 recent astronaut and rodent microbiome stu- dies,67 69 and the edible plant studies (.., Veggie).70,71 When available, these results can improve our understanding of the astronaut-microbe interaction and of the potential health risks to the astronaut. Oxidative stress The novel environmental conditions of space ight, and their combination, may affect both the generation and safe processing of reactive oxygen or nitrogen species.72,73 Evidence for oxidative- related issues in astronauts (or their analogs) can be found in the HRP Evidence Reports covering inadequate nutrition,74 extravehi- cular activity,75 and exposure to ionizing radiation.47,76 79 NASA has successfully used horizontally-integrated team science to understand and mitigate components of radiation-induced oxidative stress42 44 in mice. Visual impairment/intracranial pressure (VI/IP) During and after long-duration space ights, some astronauts have reported noticeable, persistent VIs accompanied by ophthalmic changes including globe  attening, choroidal folds, optic-disc edema, and optic-nerve kinking.80 To date, clinically signi cant changes have been observed in male, but not female, astro- nauts,81 identifying  not yet understood sex difference, CC10 (Table ). Increased intracranial pressure and optic-disc swelling (papilledema) may underlie these potentially irreversible changes.81 Current research is analyzing the effects of lowering cranial hypertension by using lower body negative pressure in astronauts during  ight and bedrest,82 supporting the CC2 goal (Table ). Clinical signs and symptoms observed in astronauts have informed and focused important mechanistic studies exemplifying reciprocal translation at NASA (.., applied to basic). For example, retinas of female mice  own on the shuttle (STS-133, STS-135), acquired by the BioSpecimen Sharing Program, exhibit altered gene expression and increased oxidative stress,83 possibly causing retinal damage, degeneration, or remodeling.84,85 Other basic research is examining morphological, histological, and molecular changes in the brains and eyes of rats exposed to head-down tilt.86 Altogether, these examples are in the early stages of mechan- istic understanding and countermeasure development. Already each has bene ted from translational approaches. We suggest that  more coordinated programmatic effort of horizontal and vertical integration will accelerate countermeasure development. In the closing section, we provide suggestions of how enhanced translational research could materialize at NASA. OPTIONS FOR NASA  FUTURE TRANSLATIONAL RESEARCH PATH Given the need for acute astronaut countermeasures to enable longer-duration missions, we recommend the following steps to catalyze translational research within NASA  Life Sciences portfolio. Building and managing partnerships Greater coordinated efforts in translational research are needed to understand and manage the integrated organismal response to space ight and enable human exploration. Current activities within NASA  SLPSRA Division are creating new opportunities for translational science both within and external to the Agency. Tools like text analytics should aid in managing the life sciences portfolio and identify new gaps in knowledge. Other government agencies, such as NIH, and other organizations, both commercial and non-pro , have been working for  number of years on Earth- based translational research goals. NASA should partner, both nationally and internationally, with external organizations to bene  from their tools, techniques, and experience, and add Life sciences translational research at NASA JS Alwood et al  npj Microgravity (2017)  Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA\n\nNASA-unique data and translational research efforts to the much larger, continually growing, and worldwide community of transla- tional research science. New collaborations NASA  Human Research and Space Biology programs should increasingly encourage translational research proposals for upcoming NASA research announcements (NRAs),87 including proposals that span traditional program boundaries or team science proposals (horizontally or vertically-integrated teams of investigators like the NSCORs or resembling the P01 Program Project Grants offered by NIH). Additionally, phased awards allowing progression from hypothesis-driven science to counter- measure development would enable vertical translation across NASA  life sciences portfolio (Figs. , ). Finally, proposals with international collaborations are encouraged to leverage the ISS platform and unique national resources (see the open NRAs and the International Space Life Sciences Working Group for research announcements). NASA  open science and data sharing Open Science approaches, allowing transparency and data sharing at all levels of society, are being developed at NASA to provide greater access to data and tissue sharing from both space and ground-based research. The goal is to engage researchers both within and outside of the NASA community (.., academia, NIH, Department of Defense, etc). These steps are essential for both optimizing the use of these valuable resources and facilitating translational research goals. NASA should continue the develop- ment and expansion of Open Science systems, such as GeneLab, to enable translational research for the broadest research community. Education, communications, and advocacy Increased activity in the Education, Communication, and Advocacy areas will be fundamental to achieve translational research goals and is  mandate of the HRP Translational Research Institute. Additionally, organizations such as the ASGSR are discussing options to engage their members who span biology, human research, physical sciences, life support, related technology development, and commercial applications in translational research pursuits. NASA should develop research fellowships, as well as educational and scienti  communication materials speci cally tailored to the Agency  translational research goals and partner with external organizations, wherever possible, to leverage the advocacy those organizations can provide. CLOSING In summary, translation research is  two-phased effort at NASA and will help accelerate countermeasure development for exploration missions. We have speci ed four areas where synergy within the existing program structures seems promising and have suggested ways in which program coordination and team science approaches can facilitate translation from discovery to develop- ment to implementation.

Sato) Abstract SNAREs play an important role in the process of membrane trafficking. In the present research, we investigated subcellular localization of an uncharacterized Arabidopsis thaliana protein reported to interact with  trans-Golgi network- localized Qa-SNARE, SYNTAXIN OF PLANTS 43. Based on the similarity of its amino acid sequence to metazoan fucosyltransferases, we have named this novel protein AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thaliana GlycosylTransferase-Like Protein) and predicted that it should be  member of yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis fucosyltransferases, as it shows no significant sequence similarity to fucosyltransferases previously identified in Arabidopsis. AtGTLP is  membrane-anchored protein, which exhibits  type II-like topology, with  single transmembrane helix and  globular domain in the -terminal part of its amino acid sequence. Colocalization data we collected suggest that AtGTLP should localize mainly to Golgi apparatus, especially to certain zones of trans-Golgi. As single atgtlp /  mutants showed no obvious difference in phenotype (primary root length and fresh mass), AtGTLP and proteins related to AtGTLP with high similarity in amino acid sequences may have redundant functions. Key words: glycosylation, Golgi apparatus, membrane trafficking, trans-Golgi network. Introduction An efficient and well-organized intracellular transport system is  basic requirement for life to exist, as many components necessary for metabolic processes, that take place inside or outside of  eukaryotic cell, are produced and subsequently modified in different cell compartments. The transport system responsible for delivering cargo collected from one compartment (that is:  membrane-enclosed organelle, such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, or vacuole) to its next destination has been given the name of  membrane traffic . In the membrane traffic, macromolecules are packed as cargo into vesicles, which then carry the cargo to another organelle, plasma membrane or extracellular space. SNARE (soluble -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor) proteins,  family of membrane-anchored proteins comprising of more than 60 members in Arabidopsis (Sanderfoot 2007), play an important role in this transport system. Assisted by other molecules, such as Rab GTPases and tethering factors, SNAREs mediate fusion between the membrane of vesicle carrying the cargo and the membrane of the organelle the cargo is addressed to (Stenmark 2009). To facilitate the fusion, SNAREs form  complex comprising of four SNAREs three -SNAREs (Qa-, Qb-, Qc- SNARE), which reside on the target membrane and are characterized by the presence of glutamine as the central amino acid in SNARE motif, in addition to one -SNARE residing on the transport vesicle, with arginine as the central amino acid (Fasshauer et al. 1998). When  -SNARE comes into contact with the three -SNAREs, first  link is formed between the vesicle and the target membrane, and subsequently, due to the change in conformation of the SNARE complex from  loose  to  tight  state, the vesicle is pulled toward the target membrane, allowing the two membranes to fuse together and the cargo to enter the lumen of the organelle (Jahn and Scheller 2006). To ensure the specificity of fusion,  large number of SNAREs localizes selectively to  specific cell compartment. This characteristic made it possible for those SNAREs to be successfully used as organelle Abbreviations: FUT, fucosyltransferase; GT, glycosyltransferase; POFUT, protein -fucosyltransferase; SNARE, soluble -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment receptor; SYP, syntaxin of plants; TGN, trans-Golgi network. Published online March 20, 2024 Original Paper\n\n36 Novel Golgi-localized putative glycosyltransferase protein Copyright   2024 Japanese Society for Plant Biotechnology markers in subcellular localization studies (Uemura et al. 2004). Through their crucial role in membrane trafficking, members of SNARE family in plants were reported to be implicit in  variety of biological processes, ranging from growth to biotic/abiotic stress resistance. One group of SNAREs, that has been linked to secretion-dependent resistance against pathogens, is SYP4 (SYNTAXIN of PLANTs ) group. SYP4 group comprises of three members (SYP41, SYP42 and SYP43) with partially overlapping functions, all localizing to the TGN (trans- Golgi network). syp42 / syp43 /  double mutant exhibits phenotype of shorter roots, semi-dwarfism, and early senescence, in addition to increase in susceptibility to host-adapted virulent powdery fungus Golovinomyces orontii infection, when compared to wild type (Uemura et al. 2012). research focused on interactome of Qa-SNARE proteins in Arabidopsis reported  number of new interactions between specific SNARE proteins and numerous proteins of diverse functions, including novel proteins with unknown functions (Fujiwara et al. 2014). One such interaction was found between SYP43 and an uncharacterized protein, which we decided to name AtGTLP (Arabidopsis thaliana GlycosylTransferase-Like Protein) due to the similarity to glycosyltransferases in its amino acid sequence. Glycosyltransferases (GTs) are  large family of enzymes, characterized by their ability to transfer sugar moieties to  specific acceptor substrate creating  glycosidic bond. GTs are known to produce  variety of glycoproteins and small sugar-containing molecules with diverse biological roles, but in plants, these enzymes are especially important for processing products of photosynthesis and for biosynthesis of cell-wall (Keegstra and Raikhel 2001). At present, 567 Arabidopsis proteins recorded in the Carbohydrate Active Enzyme Database (CAZy) (Cantarel et al. 2009;  e1.html, accessed Nov , 2023) with  GlycosylTransferase  annotation have been further classified into 45 of 117 GT families known today (including GT0 or GTnc,  non-classified ). Independently from the sequence- based classification implemented in CAZy database, GTs can also be categorized according to the type of sugar they use as  substrate. One such example is the superfamily of fucosyltransferases (FUTs), which utilize guanidine  -diphosphate- --fucose (GDP-Fuc) as  substrate (Martinez-Duncker et al. 2003). In plants, macromolecules known to incorporate fucose in their structures are -glycans, -fucosylated proteins, as well as components of cell walls, such as xyloglucans, arabinogalactan proteins and pectic polysaccharides  rhamnogalacturonan  (RG-) and rhamnogalacturonan II (RG-II) (Soto et al. 2019). Based on characteristics of FUTs that have been identified thus far ( majority of which are putative fucosyltransferases), it has been established that fucose is attached to each of these types of macromolecules by  specific FUT(). As our knowledge about plant FUTs is still lacking, the full scope of their biological functions is, at present, not fully understood. In the present study, we observed subcellular localization of AtGTLP by cross-pollinating  transgenic Arabidopsis line expressing AtGTLP-mGFP construct with organelle marker lines, as the first step to investigate the functions of AtGTLP. Materials and methods Plant material and growth conditions For colocalization observations, Arabidopsis plants were grown in growth chamber, in 22  in long-day light (16 / , /) conditions on MS medium /vitamins (Duchefa Biochemie), containing .% gellan gum (Wako) and % sucrose. pH was adjusted to .265. Fluorescence was observed in cells in the elongation zone of roots of -day-old seedlings. For analysis of mutant phenotype, two -DNA insertion lines SALK_025999 (atgtlp-) and SALK_011654 (atgtlp-) were used. Columbia- accession plants were used as  control. Growth conditions and medium were the same as for colocalization analysis. For statistical analysis of primary root length and fresh mass, 25 individuals (11-day-old) were used for each genotype. RNA extraction and RT-PCR RNA was extracted from 10-day-old Arabidopsis seedling with RNeasy  Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). 100 mg of fresh tissue was used for each sample. cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript  III Reverse Transcriptase (ThermoFisher Scientific). of the extracted RNA was added to each reaction as  template. The presence or lack of AtGTLP expression in mutant lines was confirmed by PCR reaction using ExTaq polymerase (Takara). of cDNA was used as  template. Primers used for RT-PCR are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Gene cloning  . kbp fragment of nucleotide sequence comprising of the native promoter and AtGTLP (At2g04280) gene sequence flanked by   and   UTRs was amplified using PrimeSTAR  GXL DNA Polymerase (Takara). The amplified sequence was subsequently subcloned into  pENTR  vector using pENTR / -TOPO Vector Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) for directional cloning. The vector was used to transform One Shot  TOP10 Chemically Competent Escherichia coli (ThermoFisher Scientific). Transformants were selected on solid LB medium with kanamycin 50 mg   and cultured overnight in liquid LB with the same antibiotic concentration. Isolated plasmid was linearized and fused with monomeric GFP (mGFP) (Segami\n\n. Rzepecka et al. 37 Copyright   2024 Japanese Society for Plant Biotechnology et al. 2014) gene sequence using In-Fusion HD Kit (Takara). Product of this reaction was used to transform competent . coli cells and the transformants selection procedure was repeated. Isolated plasmid was used as the entry clone for pHGW vector (Karimi et al. 2002) as the destination vector in Gateway  LR Clonase  II reaction (ThermoFisher Scientific). AtGTLP-mGFP in pHGW construct was transformed into competent . coli cells and transformant colonies were selected on solid LB medium with 100 mg   spectinomycin. For creation of mRFP-GOS12 Golgi marker line, translational fusion between mRFP (Campbell et al. 2002) and GOS12 were generated by inserting cDNA encoding mRFP in front of the start codon of GOS12 genomic sequence including . kb of the  -flanking sequence and . kb of the  -flanking sequence in pENTR  vector using In-Fusion HD Kit. The resulted mRFP-GOS12 construct was subcloned into pGWB1 by LR Clonase  II (Nakagawa et al. 2007). Primers used for gene cloning and linearization are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Generation of Arabidopsis transformants Col- plants were infected with Agrobacterium tumefaciens transformed with the prepared plasmid containing the AtGTLP-mGFP construct using flower dip method (Clough and Bent 1998). Collected seeds were sown on MS medium with % sucrose, .% agar with 25 mg   of hygromycin and 250 mg   of claforan. Selection of T1 lines with  single AtGTLP-mGFP construct was conducted by sowing T2 seeds on selective MS medium with hygromycin. Lines, for which we observed  :  segregation ratio of resistant to non-resistant plants, were selected as single- insertion lines. Confocal laser scanning microscopy observations For subcellular localization observations of AtGTLP protein, AtGTLP-mGFP single-insertion lines were cross-pollinated with organelle markers lines. mRFP-VAMP721 (Uemura et al. 2019) and tagRFP-VAMP727 (Ebine et al. 2008) lines were used as markers for transport vesicle from the TGN to the cell plate/ plasma membrane or to the vacuole, respectively. mRFP-SYP61 (Shimizu et al. 2021), mRFP-SYP43 (Asaoka et al. 2013), and VHAa1-mRFP (Dettmer et al. 2006) lines were used as TGN markers. ST-mRFP was used as  trans-Golgi marker (Uemura et al. 2012) and mRFP-GOS12 as  Golgi marker (in this study). Colocalization observations were conducted using Zeiss LSM980 with Airyscan  confocal laser scanning microscope system equipped with Plan-Apochromat 63x/.40 Oil DIC M27 immersion objective. Excitation laser wavelengths of 488 nm and 543 nm were used. Pinhole was set to 1AU. Colocalization analysis The degree of colocalization of each organelle marker with AtGTLP-mGFP was assessed by calculating Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) (Adler and Parmryd 2010; Dunn et al. 2011). To obtain PCC values, Coloc  plugin for Fiji/ImageJ software (Schindelin et al. 2012) was used. For each organelle marker, three 50   50   images with 15 randomly selected regions of interest (ROIs), freehand-drawn around the observed dot- like structures, were used for analysis (45 ROIs total for each marker). Noise in the images was corrected using the  Smooth  function of Fiji/ImageJ. Line fluorescence intensity plots were generated using RGB profiler plugin for Fiji/ImageJ. Results AtGTLP is  putative glycosyltransferase AtGTLP is predicted to be  membrane-anchored protein comprising of 568 residues.

The short -terminal tail of the protein was predicted to localize on the cytosolic side of an organelle membrane, while residues 45 568 reside inside the lumen (Figure 1A).",

The short -terminal tail of the protein was predicted to localize on the cytosolic side of an organelle membrane, while residues 45 568 reside inside the lumen (Figure 1A). AlphaFold2 (Jumper et al. 2021) model of AtGTLP  three-dimensional structure includes  globular domain of unknown function in the -terminal part of the amino acid sequence (Figure 1B). The -terminal part of the amino-acid sequence was modelled with high confidence, while -terminal part had  lower reliability score (Figure 1C ). Analysis of AtGTLP  amino acid sequence using Phyre2 server (Kelley et al. 2015;  ic.ac.uk/phyre2/html/page.cgi?id= index, accessed Nov , 2023) suggests  distant homology between the -terminal domain of AtGTLP and human protein -fucosyltransferase  (POFUT2; 19% of sequence identity, 99.% confidence), protein -fucosyltransferase  (POFUT1; 16% .., 98.% confidence), as well as . elegans protein -fucosyltransferase  (CePOFUT2; 20% .., 98.% confidence) and protein -fucosyltransferase  (CePOFUT1; 18% .., 99.% confidence). Superposition between AlphaFold2 model of -terminal domain of AtGTLP and the top ranked template (human POFUT2; PDB ID: 4AP6,  chain) is shown in Figure 1F. Interestingly, among top ranked templates, we observed no plant GTs nor other types of plant enzymes. Moreover, although the Conserved Domain Database (Lu et al. 2020;  accessed Nov , 2023) recognizes the presence of  - FUT-like  domain in the -terminal region of AtGTLP, when its amino acid sequence was used as  query in BLAST search against Arabidopsis proteome, none of the 38 proteins that have been characterized as members of Arabidopsis FUT family in literature (Smith et al. 2018) were present among the results. No other motif that could suggest possible functions of AtGTLP has been found to be present in its amino acid sequence. In the CAZy database, AtGTLP is currently classified as  GTnc . 38 Novel Golgi-localized putative glycosyltransferase protein Copyright   2024 Japanese Society for Plant Biotechnology AtGTLP is localized mainly on the trans-Golgi To investigate the subcellular localization of AtGTLP, we established transgenic Arabidopsis expressing mGFP- tagged AtGTLP (AtGTLP-mGFP) under the control of native promoter. The fluorescence of AtGTLP-mGFP protein concentrated in dot- or ring-like structures scattered within the cell (Figure ). In order to reveal which organelle those structures correspond to, we established double-visualization Arabidopsis lines expressing AtGTLP-mGFP with various RFP-tagged organelle markers. Among tested markers, the extent of colocalization of AtGTLP with trans-Golgi marker, ST (Boevink et al. 1998) was the highest and relatively consistent among all analyzed ROIs (Figure ; PCC= . .91; median= .75), suggesting that  significant population of AtGTLP localizes to trans-Golgi. Visual observations of colocalization of these two proteins show that while both seem to often localize to the same disk-like structures, patches of magenta-only and green-only fluorescence within those structures were also visible (Figure 2A,  close-up ). Based on this characteristic, we suspect that within trans- Golgi, AtGTLP segregates to specific zones only. As expected, relatively high PCCs were obtained also when colocalization with GOS12,  Golgi marker (Figure 2B; Uemura et al. 2004), was analyzed (Figure ; .21 .83, median= .58). However, whereas for the AtGTLP- mGFP/ST-mRFP pair, the two peaks representing GFP and RFP in side-view line fluorescence profile of  single disk-like structure overlap almost entirely (Figure 4A), for the AtGTLP-mGFP/mRFP-GOS12 pair  slight shift between those two peaks was observed (Figure 4B). Moreover, we found that in some of the analyzed ROIs, AtGTLP partially colocalizes with TGN markers, SYP61 (Figure 2C; Uemura et al. 2004) and VHAa1 (Figure 2D; Dettmer et al. 2006), whereas in other ROIs, PCC was Figure .

Rzepecka et al. 39 Copyright   2024 Japanese Society for Plant Biotechnology close to zero (Figure ; PCC= . .65; median= .41 and PCC= .01 .79; median= .46, respectively). Side-view line fluorescence profiles for these two markers show  similar shift between the GFP and RFP peaks (Figure 4C, ). Interestingly, for the third analyzed TGN marker used in this study, SYP43 (Uemura et al. 2004), we observed that areas where the two colors of florescence overlap with each other, were scarcer (Figure 2E). Relatively low degree of colocalization for AtGTLP- mGFP/mRFP-SYP43 pair was also reflected in lower PCC values (Figure ;  .17 .64, with median of .26) and line fluorescence profile, which suggest that SYP43 localizes to the center of AtGTLP rings (Figure 4E). Taking into consideration the possibility that AtGTLP is transported within the cell as  cargo, two transport pathway markers VAMP721,  marker of transport from the TGN to the cell plate and the plasma membrane, as well as VAMP727,  marker of vacuolar transport (Shimizu and Uemura 2022) were also included in the study. In case of VAMP721, we observed very little overlap of GFP and RFP fluorescence (Figure 2F, Figure 4F), and low PCCs (Figure ;  .48 .48, median= .15), whereas colocalization between AtGTLP and VAMP727, similarly to SYP61 and VHAa1, was inconsistent across the analyzed ROIs (Figure 2G, Figure ; PCC= .01 ., median= .42). Line fluorescence profiles for AtGTLP-GFP/tagRFP-VAMP727 pair also show  pattern similar to AtGTLP-GFP/mRFP- SYP61 pair (Figure 4G). When inspecting the degree of colocalization visually, we observed that the areas of overlapping fluorescence were present mainly within clusters of dot- or ring-like structures, which most likely correspond to Golgi/TGN. In addition to these clusters,  free  dots of tagRFP-VAMP727 signal, where AtGTLP- mGFP was absent, could also be observed (Figure 2G, arrowheads). atgtlp mutants exhibit no obvious phenotypes According to data available in eFP Browser (Klepikova Arabidopsis Atlas; Klepikova et al. 2016), AtGTLP is expressed in most parts of  plant, including roots and young leaves, with the exception of dry seeds. In both mutant lines used in this study, -DNA insertion was confirmed to be present inside AtGTLP  exon (Figure 5A). Although the results of RT-PCR Figure . Subcellular localization of AtGTLP.

Three separate images were analyzed (15 ROIs/image) for each marker. Median is shown for each marker. 40 Novel Golgi-localized putative glycosyltransferase protein Copyright   2024 Japanese Society for Plant Biotechnology confirmed that transcription of AtGTLP in both of the -DNA lines is absent or reduced to levels undetectable with this method (Figure 5B), growth of mutant plants was comparable to wild type plants, and we could not observe any distinctive phenotype differences between atgtlp- or atgtlp- single mutants and wild-type plants in -day-old and 11-day-old seedlings (Figure 5C, ). Discussion Trans-Golgi localization of AtGTLP In our subcellular localization study, we found that AtGTLP colocalized well with the trans-Golgi marker, ST, as well as with the Golgi marker, GOS12. Based on these results, we consider AtGTLP to be  resident Golgi protein, localizing mainly to trans-Golgi. Furthermore, the ring-like appearance of AtGTLP-mGFP fluorescence suggest that it localizes mainly to the rim of Golgi cisternae (Tie et al. 2018). The results of this study showed that the predicted characteristics of AtGTLP match that of glycosyltransferases. In eukaryotic cells, glycosylation processes are commonly thought to occur mainly in ER and Golgi (Hansen et al. 2010). In plants, biosynthesis of many cell wall polysaccharides, another process that involves GTs, was also reported to take place in Golgi (Keegstra and Raikhel 2001; Saint-Jore-Dupas et al. 2004). Predicted topology model of AtGTLP suggests that it possesses  short cytoplasmic -terminal tail and  single transmembrane helix, while its globular functional domain is positioned inside the lumen. Such topology, often described as  type II topology  in literature, is common among Golgi-resident enzymes known to take part in protein glycosylation processes (Banfield 2011; Hansen et al. 2010; Welch and Munro 2019). Our data suggest that whilst AtGTLP partially colocalized with TGN markers, SYP61 and VHAa1, and to  lesser extent, SYP43, in  portion of the analyzed ROIs, the number of ROIs, where the Pearson correlation coefficient was close to , which suggests no colocalization, is noteworthy. TGN is  vesicular- tubular compartment adjacent to the trans side of  Golgi apparatus, but generally considered to be  distinct organelle with functions different from the Golgi (Griffiths and Simons 1986). Indeed, more recently, existence of two types of TGN in plant cells, Golgi- associated TGN (GA-TGN) and Golgi-independent TGN (free-TGN/GI-TGN)  subpopulation of the TGN that is physiologically separated from Golgi stacks, has been reported (Staehelin and Kang 2008; Uemura et al. 2014; Viotti et al. 2010). The general role of TGN is to receive proteins modified in Golgi and direct them either for vacuoles, the plasma membrane or for secretion (Griffiths and Simons 1986) and therefore, this organelle is considered to be an important hub in the membrane traffic system, where cargo proteins are sorted, before being dispatched for their next destination (Keller and Simons 1997).

Rzepecka et al. 41 Copyright   2024 Japanese Society for Plant Biotechnology involved in transport, other TGN-localized proteins include lipid-processing enzymes, which help to pack cargo proteins into transport vesicles (Gu et al. 2001). Glycosylation is  sequential process, in which different types of sugar are added to glycans in  specific order, as the modified macromolecule travels from ER through Golgi apparatus to finally reach the TGN. In mammalian cells, some types of sugars, such as galactose and sialic acid, can be added to glycans in the TGN by TGN- localized GTs (Rabouille et al. 1995; Stanley 2011). In plants, however, there are no reports of glycotransferase activity in the TGN. Based on the collected data, we therefore propose that AtGTLP is  trans-Golgi-localized protein. AtGTLP  novel fucosyltransferase? Analysis of AtGTLP amino acid sequence has shown that its -terminal domain bears resemblance to the conserved domain found in metazoan POFUTs, although no obvious sequence similarity was found between AtGTLP and the proteins which have been previously classified as members of FUT family in Arabidopsis. Although, at present, we lack evidence that would confirm GT or FUT activity in AtGTLP, we consider that this protein may potentially belong to  yet uncharacterized family of Arabidopsis proteins with either GT or FUT activity. One interesting possibility that is worth considering is that AtGTLP is indeed  POFUT. Phylogenetic analyses report putative POFUTs in plants and suggest plant POFUTs are phylogenetically distant from POFUTs families in other organisms (POFUT1 and POFUT2 families) (Hansen et al. 2012; Soto et al. 2019). Interestingly however, recently described Arabidopsis putative POFUT, -FUCOSYLTRANSFERASE1 (AtOFT1), implicit in pollen tube penetration through the stigma-style interface, was reported to diverge from this pattern. Phylogenetic analysis of AtOFT1 has shown that it exhibits  relatively high sequence identity to members of POFUT1 family, compared to other putative POFUTs found in Arabidopsis (Smith et al. 2018). As in silico analysis suggests that AtGTLP may also be potentially related to metazoan POFUTs, the possibility that yet uncharacterized families of POFUTs, more related to metazoan POFUTs than previously reported POFUTs, exist in Arabidopsis genome is worth further examinations. In our subcellular localization study, we found that AtGTLP localizes mainly to trans-Golgi. Human POFUT1 and POFUT2 localize to the ER (Luo and Haltiwanger 2005; Luo et al. 2006), where the - glycosylation process for most proteins starts (Stanley 2011). Arabidopsis POFUT with confirmed activity, SPINDY, is known to be active in nucleus/cytoplasm (Bi et al. 2023; Kumar et al. 2023; Zentella et al. 2023). However, it is the only POFUT discovered thus far with this subcellular localization (Sun 2021). On the other hand, putative Arabidopsis POFUTs, such as AtOFT1 (Robichaux et al. 2023; Smith et al. 2018), as well as FRIABLE1 (Neumetzler et al. 2012) and ESMERALDA1 (Verger et al. 2016) were experimentally shown to localize to Golgi.

In relation to AtGTLP showing distant similarity to metazoan POFUTs, alternative possibility is that it may be  new type of plant fucosyltransferase. One type of macromolecules, which contain fucose are pectic polysaccharides RG- and RG-II. At present, biosynthesis of RG- and RG-II is not fully understood, and no specific fucosyltransferase, which could be linked to synthesis of RG- and RG-II side chains, has been identified (Soto et al. 2019; Voxeur et al. 2012), suggesting that yet uncharacterized type of fucosyltransferase is present in plants and responsible for this process. GTs are  diverse family of enzymes and very few members of FUT family in Arabidopsis has been well-characterized thus far. Despite the fact that characteristics of AtGTLP, such as its trans-Golgi localization, type II topology and the presence of - FUT-like conserved domain, seem to agree with the assumption that it is  member of the glycosyltransferase family, the data currently available are not enough to conclusively state that AtGTLP is  GT or  type of FUT, precisely. Under standard growth conditions, atgtlp /  single mutant displayed phenotype indistinguishable from Col- plants and one possible explanation for this result is that AtGTLP and related proteins with high amino acid sequence similarity to AtGTLP might have redundant functions. Protein At4g12700, which shows  very high sequence similarity to AtGTLP is one potential candidate. Further research is needed to confirm the presence of glycosyltransferase/fucosyltranferase activity, as well as the biological role of AtGTLP. Acknowledgements We thank .

As an example, for the case of how to query and identify datasets within NASA  GeneLab database and demonstrate the database utility, we used an unbiased systems biology method for identifying key genes/drivers for the contribution of space radiation on the cardiovascular system. This knowledge can contribute to designing appropriate experiments targeting these speci  pathways. Microarray data from cardiomyocytes of male C57BL/ mice followed-up for 28 days after exposure to 900 mGy of  GeV proton or 150 mGy of  GeV/ 56Fe were compared to human endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured for  days on the International Space Station (ISS). We observed common molecular pathways between simulated space radiation and HUVECs  own on the ISS. The analysis suggests FYN is the central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation: the known oxidative stress induced immediately following radiation would only be transient and would upregulate FYN, which in turn would reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, protecting the cardiovascular system. The transcriptomic signature of exposure to protons was also much closer to the space ight signature than 56Fe  signature. To our knowledge, this is the  rst time GeneLab datasets were utilized to provide potential biological indications that the majority of ions on the ISS are protons, clearly illustrating the power of omics analysis. More generally, this work also demonstrates how to combine animal radiation studies done on the ground and space ight studies to evaluate human risk in space.

Introduction Long-duration space travel has been associated with  number of human health risk factors, such as space radiation, microgravity, isolation, and hypoxia [ ]. It is now thought that the two main factors driving the majority of the health risks are space radiation and microgravity, with space radiation being the main component for health risk for space missions beyond low Earth orbit (LEO) [ 10]. The different organs and related health issues potentially induced by these two aspects of the space environment are continuously studied and updated. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 661; doi:10.3390/ijms20030661 www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 661  of 22 Space radiation observed on the International Space Station (ISS) is quite different from ionizing radiation found on Earth and is composed primarily of protons (both high and low energy) and HZE ions (high () atomic number () and energy () ions). Protons are characterized by low linear energy transfer (LET) and HZE by high LET, as opposed to the low LET radiation (-,  -, or  -rays) to which humans are commonly exposed to on Earth [,,10 13]. HZE ions are positively charged and are the highly ionizing components of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) which originate outside of the solar system. The strong carcinogenic potential of HZE [14] has been  concern for many decades and has been considered the biggest risk factor for human health in missions beyond LEO [13,15]. In contrast, in LEO, where the ISS is located, the radiation dose from HZE is reduced due to the protection provided by the Earth  magnetosphere, and is roughly equal to the dose from low-energy protons trapped in the inner radiation belt [13,16]. Most of the ISS orbit lies inside the radiation belts; the majority of the dose is from passages through the South Atlantic Anomaly, where the inner belt drops down to ISS altitudes. An additional risk for missions beyond LEO is from acute doses of high-energy protons from periodic solar particle events (SPEs) [14]. Data on the biological effects of space radiation has been obtained sporadically in true space conditions from samples  own in LEO (ISS, Space Shuttle, Mir Space Station, satellites carrying biology payloads). The majority of our data has been generated by simulating space radiation on Earth using speci  HZE ions or protons at facilities such as the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Simulated space radiation ground experiments have typically focused  lot more on HZE, re ecting the space radiation environment encountered in  long-duration beyond LEO mission [17]. To this day,  variety of results indicates that space radiation can increased cancer risk as well as contribute to diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), muscle degeneration, bone loss, and cardiovascular disease [10,15]. Radiation-induced late cardiovascular disease in astronauts is one increasingly prominent concern [,18 20]. Although many experiments using low-LET radiation have been conducted to show damage to the microvasculature, HZE particle data are limited, and the implications for disease risk need more study. There have been even fewer ground-based studies of the synergistic effects of space radiation and microgravity, which more closely mimic the environment in space. Data from atomic bomb survivors, albeit with different types of radiation, on increased incidence of cardiovascular disease have shown long-lasting effects decades after radiation exposure impacting increased ischemic heart disease, hypertension, and stroke with doses as low as  Gy [21 23]. Animal and cell culture models have been used to simulate HZE particle and proton radiation and have shown that low doses of high-LET radiation can drastically affect the cardiovascular system [,20,24 28]. Speci cally, one experiment showed that mice exposed to . Gy of 150 MeV protons or . Gy of 600 MeV/ iron ions (56Fe) experienced large changes in cardiac DNA methylation with potential impacts including heart failure and cardiomyopathy [29]. 56Fe is the most predominant HZE particle in the GCRs, and is  commonly used surrogate for GCR HZE. Other experiments have shown that cells and animal models exposed to proton and HZE radiation increase DNA oxidation, myocardial  brosis, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular damage [24,27,28,30]. Although these experiments and data have contributed to the overall knowledge of cardiovascular disease risk from space travel, there are many potential confounding factors besides space radiation (.., stress, hypoxia, microgravity). Therefore, our overall understanding of the contribution of space radiation in cardiovascular disease risk and their mechanisms remain an open question. To further pursue the cardiovascular impact due to space radiation we utilized publicly available transcriptomic data that is available on NASA  GeneLab platform (genelab.nasa.gov) [17] related to cardiovascular disease and the space environment. NASA  GeneLab platform is  resource available to the public that has provided the  rst comprehensive omics database related to space. Due to the limited omics data available related to space radiation and cardiovascular disease, we analyzed two datasets from ground experiments designed to characterize the long-term impact following space irradiation (protons and 56Fe) on cardiomyocytes for  ve different time-points up to 28 days after irradiation and one space ight experiment studying the impact of human umbilical vein endothelial\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 661  of 22 cells (HUVECs) cultivated in the space environment on the ISS for seven days. Two components that make up the cardiac tissue are cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells and both cell types are heavily involved with cardiac remodeling and regeneration [31]. Although there are more components to the cardiac tissue, from the datasets available from the GeneLab related to the cardiovascular system, we will only focus on these components. Using these datasets, we hypothesized that there are common long-term molecules and pathways modulating the cardiovascular system due to radiation effects during space ight. Using  systems biology approach, we were able to suggest  novel mechanism through the FYN pathway [32 35] that the cardiovascular system uses to reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels when exposed to space radiation. Brie , FYN is  member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases that has been previously shown to be heavily involved with the cardiovascular system through cardiomyocyte remodeling [36,37] and also leads to activation due to ROS [32,33,38,39]. In addition to FYN  involvement with the cardiovascular system, it has also been reported to be  tumor suppressor [40,41],  key player in controlling immune receptor signaling status and in ammation [42], and has been shown to affect myelination of the central nervous system through crosstalk with Erk1/ signaling [43]. For our  ndings, although the ROS levels are reduced through Fyn signaling, we show the potential of other pathways that will still contribute to increased cardiovascular risk in the space environment such as increased in ammation. In addition, we are able to suggest that HUVEC cells grown on the ISS in LEO show  molecular response that is in agreement with responses observed on Earth with simulated protons but with less commonality with heavier HZE ions, as one would expect from the predominance of protons found in LEO space radiation. This  nding is critical as it highlights the relevance of simulated space radiation experiments conducted on Earth, as they are shown here as able to recapitulate what is observed in space. This work illustrates the power of unbiased omics analysis and how the GeneLab database has become an essential tool to better characterize the response of  life to space environment. More generally, these novel  ndings have potential to contribute to current cardiovascular risk models for space ight. . Results .. Global Analysis of Simulated Space Radiation Ground Experiments Compared to Space ight Samples To study the impact of space radiation on the cardiovascular system we utilized three GeneLab datasets (GLDS-52, -117, and -109). As described in detail in the methods, two datasets were focused on simulated space radiation studies performed on the ground. More speci cally, male C57BL/ mice received either an acute whole-body irradiation of 900 mGy proton at  GeV (GLDS-117) or 150 mGy 56Fe at  GeV/ (GLDS-109). Subsequently, cardiomyocytes were isolated and  xed from mice sacri ced at  ve different time-points post-irradiation. Unfortunately,  Gy control for the original study was acquired only at the  rst time-point (.., day ). Although this is not the most optimal setup for these types of experiments, we will show that former datasets from GeneLab without the desired experimental setup can still produce meaningful results to guide space biology research. To test if simulated space radiation studies relate to the space environment, we also analyzed  space ight study (GLDS-52) which cultivated HUVECs on the ISS for  days before the cells were  xed. The HUVEC controls for the GLDS-52 datasets were cultured for the same length and methodology as the samples  own on the ISS, but were done on Earth [44]. Although all datasets utilized for this analysis were from microarray platforms, due to the incompatibility and batch effects that arise between different experiments, we had to analyze each dataset separately. We used either one-way ANOVA analysis for the simulated space radiation studies (all time-points were used to determine the signi cant genes) or -test analysis with  -value  .05 for the space ight study. We produced the following statistically signi cant genes for each condition: for the proton study (GLDS-117) there were 2540 signi cantly regulated genes, for the 56Fe study (GLDS-109) there were 5554 signi cantly regulated genes, and for the space ight study (GLDS-52) there were 823 signi cantly regulated genes. We also checked the number of genes that would be produced with more stringent statistics using the adjusted Bonferroni\n\nInt. . Mol.

This approach produced the following number of genes for each condition: for the proton study (GLDS-117) there were  or  signi cantly regulated genes with either FDR  .05 or .10, for the 56Fe study (GLDS-109) there were  or 12 signi cantly regulated genes with either FDR  .05 or .10, and for the space ight study (GLDS-52) there were no signi cantly regulated genes with either FDR cutoff. Note that our results do not agree with the original analysis published on the ground studies data [45]. Coleman et al. reported 5220 signi cant genes for 56Fe and 1651 signi cant genes for proton datasets using  -value cutoff of .05 using one-way ANOVA analysis. Similarly, they reported 1538 signi cant genes using FDR < .10 with Benjamini Hochberg correction. We were unable to reproduce the reported number of genes following the same procedure. Such discrepancy illustrates the importance of standard processing pipeline for analysis, as the protocol reported in Coleman et al. was not suf cient to allow reproducibility. One must note here that microarray analysis is highly sensitive in the way one normalizes data, with many available methods. For this reason, the Genelab team has established standardized processing work ows for all raw omics data ( gov/genelab/projects). These pipelines were obtained as  consensus between more than 100 scientists who have joined the GeneLab Analysis Working Group (AWG) and covered transcriptomics (RNAseq and microarray), as well as metagenomics, epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. The GeneLab team is in the process of documenting all these pipelines and making them available progressively online via the GeneLab toolshed ( For the two ground studies presented in this manuscript, the low number of replicates were incompatible with the stringent statistical method we recommend for GeneLab microarray data. Therefore, we could not utilize it here as it would not produce enough signi cant genes for  meta-analysis of this kind. We used instead  statistically acceptable but less stringent method (see Materials and Methods). We recommend the readers to go to the GeneLab toolshed for the latest recommended approach. The global differences between all the time-points and conditions were assessed for each dataset (Figure ). Using principal component analysis (PCA), we were able to distinguish global differences between the controls and the experimental groups (Figure 1A ). Overall for both proton and 56Fe ion irradiation, the  Gy control samples were clustered separately from the rest of the irradiated samples (Figure 1A,). It is interesting to note that the samples that produced the greatest separation were the cardiomyocytes isolated at the longest time-points (either 26 or 28 days) after irradiation. This is apparent in the principle component  (PC2) axis for protons (Figure 1A) and for 56Fe ions these points are clustering further apart in the negative PC1 axis from all other samples. This could be interpreted as space radiation (.., protons and 56Fe) producing long-lasting impact on the biology with  progressive response overtime. However, we cannot say for certain as there was no  Gy control done for the 26 day time-point. In contrast, when comparing space ight to ground controls for the HUVECs cultivated on the ISS (Figure 1C), we observed  much cleaner separation between the groups on the PCA plot. When considering only the signi cantly regulated genes we see more re ned separation between the different experimental groups (Figure 1D ). For the signi cantly regulated genes, the  Gy controls in general were clustered independently from the rest of the irradiated samples with what appears to be  time dependence with the gene signature changing for each timepoint after the acute dose. There also was  distinct group of genes that were oppositely regulated for HUVECs  own in space compared to the ground controls. This data indicates that there is  distinct gene signature associated with space radiation and the impact of one acute dose can potentially have long-lasting effects on the cardiovascular system.

Sci. 2019, 20, 661  of 22 .. Dose Received by HUVECs Flown in Space The data are from the European Space Agency-Integrated Experiment (ESA-SPHINX) experiment (10/31/10 11//10) [44]. The cells were launched to the ISS on  Russian Progress supply vehicle, cultured for  days in the KUBIK incubator on the European Space Agency (ESA) Columbus module, and then  xed. To be able to compare the dose received on the ISS to the simulated radiation ground studies, we obtained dose data from  detector located on the Columbus. (Data provided kindly by . Berger from the German Aerospace Center (DLR)). The measured dose rate was almost constant throughout the experiment with an average of 220.43  Gy/day (in water) with  standard deviation of .90  Gy/day (in water) measured over the period of the experiment (Data provided kindly by . Berger from the DLR and additional details can be found in the original publication [44]). The total dose was .544 mGy (in water) with the dose equivalent to . mSv, of which 58% was from high-energy protons and other GCR ions, and 42% from low-energy protons in the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA). The actual dose to the samples was probably somewhat lower, as they were shielded by the incubator. Here it is important to make the distinction between particle energy and LET, which is essentially energy loss per unit path length and is proportional to the square of the charge. Linear energy transfer (LET) is  measure of how ionizing  particle is; because they are singly charged, both high- and low-energy protons are relatively low LET. .. Common Pathways between Simulated Space Radiation and Space ight Samples To fully understand the speci  and long-lasting effects of space radiation on biology, we have to understand the general pathways that are being regulated. We  rst utilized gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [46] to determine signi cant pathways being regulated for each condition with an FDR  .05. Using the Hallmarks ( more generalized pathway database, see Figure ) and Reactome (Figure ) gene sets for GSEA, we were able to identify key pathways that are commonly being regulated for all ground controls compared to the space ight samples or irradiated samples. We  rst observed that the majority of pathways for most time-points after radiation for the cardiomyocytes that were commonly regulated with the HUVEC space ight samples were downregulated (with the exception of one time-point at  day for samples irradiated with protons for some nodes) (Figure 2A). The time-points and samples were associated with each wedge in the node as displayed in the  gure legend for Figure . Speci cally, ROS pathways were surprisingly downregulated (indicating  decrease in ROS production) for the majority of the conditions, which suggests an immediate and persistent impact of space radiation on the cardiovascular system, which is also observed on  ight samples as well. The other pathways that were downregulated have been shown from the literature to be connected to the ROS pathway. For example, fatty acid metabolism, which is one of the primary sources of energy for cardiac muscle, has  direct link to ROS formation and regulation through the mitochondria (Figure ) [47]. It is interesting to note that it has been reported that the ROS production from the mitochondria is an important mechanism of how ROS impacts cardiac tissue [48]. Knocking out MYC has been shown to cause low levels of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (Figures  and ) [49]. It is known that oxidative phosphorylation will produce ROS [50] and with the downregulation of MYC, this can potentially reduce oxidative phosphorylation levels which in turn will reduce ROS. Reactive oxygen species have also been shown to promote adipogenesis [51] and will be involved with heme metabolism (Figure ) [52]. We also observed an overall downregulation of cell cycle pathways (Figure ). We believe that this might be potentially due to the downregulation of ROS signaling, since it has been previously shown that ROS can heavily in uence the cell cycle [53]. The downregulation of ROS seems to also lead to overall downregulation of cell cycle pathways (Figure ). In general, ROS have been shown to be critically involved with the development of cardiovascular disease [52]. Through all these related downregulated pathways, we show that ROS potentially have long-lasting (Figure ) effects directly linked to the space environment on the cardiovascular systems. On the other hand, surprisingly DNA repair hallmarks were downregulated for all irradiated samples at any time-point, whereas it was upregulated in space (Figure , top right\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 661  of 22 panel). This result is unexpected as DNA repair is de nitely expected early after exposure and suggests the cardiac response is quite different. Figure .

The analysis suggests FYN is the central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation: the known oxidative stress induced immediately following radiation would only be transient and would upregulate FYN, which in turn would reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, protecting the cardiovascular system. The transcriptomic signature of exposure to protons was also much closer to the spaceflight signature than 56Fe’s signature. To our knowledge, this is the first time GeneLab datasets were utilized to provide potential biological indications that the majority of ions on the ISS are protons, clearly illustrating the power of omics analysis. More generally, this work also demonstrates how to combine animal radiation studies done on the ground and spaceflight studies to evaluate human risk in space.",

The Biological Pathways Elicited by Protons Have Stronger Overlap with Space ight Samples Than Those Elicited by 56Fe Ions To test if one type of space radiation has  predominant effect on  space ight sample, one can compare the predicted pathways from one radiation condition alone with space ight samples. Figure 2C shows that the majority of pathways speci cally in common with protons and space ight were upregulated, while Figure 2D shows the 56Fe component in common with space ight was downregulated. TGF  signaling has been shown in the past to be  key player with regulating the overall system with proton irradiation (Figure ) [11,54,55]. In order to further validate these results, we use another functional prediction tool, Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), to predict the involvement of speci  upstream regulators, biofunctions, and canonical pathways in the various datasets (Figure 4A ). In general, the overall pathways and functions overlap with the GSEA  ndings. For example, we observed in the upstream regulator predictions that MYC is downregulated for the majority for the pathways. We also observed that the following upstream regulators were predicted to activate or inhibit in the same directions as the GSEA predictions: p53, HIF1A, IL2, and IL6. The mTOR signaling canonical pathway also overlaps with the GSEA predictions. We were interested in determining how these overall functions from the ground experiments will group with the space ight samples. Using the activation -scores from the IPA results we were able to provide direct comparisons between all the samples, which we were not able to perform with the expression values due to the incompatibility of the microarray outputs. Using principal component analysis on -scores, we show that all cardiomyocyte samples irradiated with protons have biofunctions, upstream regulators and canonical pathways which cluster closely to the space ight samples (Figure 4D ). In contrast, IPA functional predictions for cardiomyocytes from mice irradiated\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 661  of 22 with 56Fe are nicely grouped together for three of the time-points ( day,  days, and 14 days), while  days and 28 days seem to behave as outliers when compared to the other datasets. Overall, all time-points for 56Fe were clearly separated from the space ight and proton irradiated samples in the PC1 axis. Since the appropriate controls were not used for these datasets by the original investigators, we felt it appropriate to provide the potential that these two time-points may be outliers and  person may consider to remove these points from additional analysis. It is important to demonstrate how less than ideal GeneLab datasets can still have potential to provide meaningful results. This result is also evident on Figure 4A , where most predicted IPA functions have negative -scores for  out of  56Fe time-points, whereas all proton time-points and  ight samples show positive -scores (red). These results indicate that the overall functional impact on samples caused by space radiation on the ISS are due to protons rather than HZE ions. In the past it has been dif cult to determine which component of the ions in space will impact samples on the ISS. Previous models have predicted that due to SPEs and the protection of the magnetosphere around the Earth from HZE ions, astronauts should be mainly exposed to protons at LEO [,10,13,15,16]. To our knowledge this is the  rst time suggesting from data utilized from the GeneLab that at LEO, protons will be the majority of ions that samples are exposed to. This data can provide  contribution to relating the biology being observed on the ISS to the correct type of irradiation that samples are exposed to. .. Key Driving Genes Provide Direct Connection to ROS for Space Radiation Impact on the Cardiovascular System To determine the key driving genes in an unbiased methodology we used an established systems biology approach that identi es the key genes involved in explaining the predicted biological functions changed by  speci  treatment [54 60]. Our data has shown potential long-lasting impact of cardiomyocytes when comparing to the basal  day controls. Due to the original study design we did not have the optimal controls to compare to every time-point, but since there are relevant biological changes occurring when compared to the basal ( day) ground controls, we hypothesis that there will be consistent long-lasting impact on cardiomyocytes isolated from mice irradiated with protons and 56Fe ion irradiation. In addition, this will also show how to creatively utilize less than ideal GeneLab datasets to generate meaningful biology to guide future research. For the key gene analysis, we pooled all irradiated time-points together to determine the common key driving genes for each type of radiation. Since we also observed that the  day and 28 day time-points for 56Fe vs. the control were acting as outliers (Figure 4D ), we performed an additional key genes analysis excluding those time-points. This will only affect the key genes associated with 56Fe. This is an essential strategy to better identify the key genes speci  to space radiation, which are able to relate back to the space ight data. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 661 10 of 22 Figure . Predicted functions and upstream regulators affected by space radiation for HUVECs exposed to the space environment and cardiomyocytes from mice exposed to protons and 56Fe ion irradiation with multiple time-points after irradiation. The predicted statistically signi cant biofunctions (), upstream regulators (), and canonical pathways (), determined through Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) from data for each individual dataset using activation -score statistics. Heat map representation of the activation -score values (red = positive activation -score for activation and blue = negative activation -score for inhibition) with hierarchical clustering by complete linkage and Euclidean distance calculation for datasets and conditions were used to display the data. The prevalence of change (or % of dataset) on the left side of the heat maps represents how common that factor is throughout all datasets/tissues with the darkest color representing factors with the highest degree in common. Time after irradiation, cell type, and experiment is color coded on the top of the heat maps. For all heat maps we are only showing the prevalence of change for the functions associated with the top  (..,  prevalence of change score  ). Global clustering of the biofunctions (), upstream regulators (), and canonical pathways () for all samples are shown by principal component analysis (PCA). For the PCA plots we used all functions for each datapoint regardless of the prevalence of change score. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 661 11 of 22 Utilizing the unbiased methodology described in the methods and further explained previously [54 57], we found utilizing all time-points nine persistent key genes for cardiomyocytes isolated from mice that received 150 mGy 56Fe and seven persistent key genes for cardiomyocytes isolated from mice that received 900 mGy protons. From the HUVECs  own on the ISS for seven days, we found nine key genes (Figure 5A). When excluding the outlier time-points for 56Fe ( and 28 days), we obtain 85 key genes for cardiomyocytes isolated from mice that received 150 mGy 56Fe (Figure 5B). We were able to determine the connectivity of these key genes between the experiments through network analysis. This allowed us to  nd potential relationships with how the ground studies relate to the space ight experiments, and the central hubs or the most connected key genes that might be responsible for space radiation effects on the cardiovascular system. We found that the key/driving genes that are the central hubs are: FYN, LCK, AKT1 being upregulated and LYN and FOS being downregulated with FYN being the overall central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation (Figure 5A). It is worth noting the activation of FYN is  key event which prevents cardiac cell death and ROS production [35,36]. Interestingly it is known that LCK, LYN, and FYN are part of the SRC-family kinases (SFKs) [37,61 63] and have been associated with various aspects of cardiovascular disease [62,64 67]. In addition, FYN and AKT1 are shown to be pivotal with angiogenic functions and the relation to cardiovascular disease [68,69]. Lastly, utilizing -scores through IPA we were able to show that these key genes provide  predicted inhibition of cell death of cardiomyocytes, congenital heart disease, and cardiac  brillation (Figure ). There also is  predicted in ammation of the organs which can cause negative health risk. Through an unbiased methodology we were able to show  link of key driving genes between ground and space ight studies that potential will have direct impact on the cardiovascular system. For the key genes analysis excluding the two outlier points (Figure 5B), since there were more key genes for 56Fe, additional predictions can be made for the functions related to cardiovascular system. For those key genes we show that in addition the functional impact described above, we also observe  predicted activation for damage to the heart. This can be attributed to potential damage caused by the key genes associated with 56Fe to promote damage to the heart tissue. In addition, we also observe three genes that overlap between the cardiomyocytes irradiation with protons and 56Fe: CD4, CD3G, and LCK. These genes are shown to be oppositely regulated between the irradiation conditions that can indicate potential different functional impact that can occur with the different ions. Since we are indicating that the majority of the ions that are affecting samples at LEO are protons (Figure 4D ), for our interpretation of the overall data we will consider the upregulation of these three genes associated with proton irradiation to be the impact it will have on the samples. .. Predicted Circulating miRNA Signature Associated with Space Radiation Cardiovascular Risk We recently predicted  microRNA (miRNA) signature that was associated with microgravity and potential the space environment [54]. Utilizing  Cytoscape [70] plugin referred to as ClueGo [71], we were able to predict the top 30 miRNAs associated with the key genes (Figure ).

Discussion For long-term space travel, cardiovascular risk is  major concern to astronauts and is thought to arise from both microgravity effects and exposure to space radiation. Here we focused on how NASA  GeneLab platform and datasets can be utilized to suggest the potential impact of space radiation on the cardiovascular system. Through an unbiased systems biology approach, we utilized three datasets (GLDS-52, -109, and -117) from NASA  GeneLab platform that were related to space radiation and the cardiovascular system. Two of the datasets were from ground studies focused on cardiomyocytes that were isolated from mice after an acute whole-body dose of either 900 mGy of protons or 150 mGy of 56Fe [45]. The other study observed HUVECs for  days on the ISS [44]. As noted previously, the HUVECs received  total dose of .544 mGy, mostly from low LET protons. Through our unbiased analysis we were able to suggest: ) that, consistent with the dose data, the majority of the radiation experienced on the ISS is potentially from protons (Figure 4D  and Figure ),  novel response mechanism of the cardiovascular system to prevent damage caused by space radiation through the activation of FYN. By identifying the key genes in all three datasets, we proposed that FYN is the most connected gene and is therefore the central hub for this common biological response. This leads us to hypothesize that there is  feedback loop triggered by the oxidative stress induced by space radiation that upregulates FYN which in turn reduces ROS levels, and thus ROS pathways. Interestingly, this feedback loop is accompanied with  downregulation of the DNA repair pathway in the animals but not in the HUVECs  own in space, suggesting  response that is more targeted to the cardiovascular system in  full organism (Figure ). By reducing ROS formation, cardiomyocyte and endothelial cells are less likely to die, leading to an overall protection of the cardiovascular system (Figure ). More speci cally, FYN was found to be upregulated within each group of the key genes associated with each dataset providing an overall predicted inhibition of ROS and cell death, while causing an activation of in ammation due to space radiation. This effect was suggested to be long-term since the key factors were from common genes being regulated the same direction up to 28 days after irradiation for the ground studies. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 661 14 of 22 Figure . schematic of the mechanism involved with the space radiation impact on the cardiovascular system. We determined that through the upregulation of FYN (the determined key/central driver involved with space radiation), ROS is downregulated to protect against the upregulation due to space radiation. Although FYN is predicted to be the central player, the other key genes involved from each dataset (Figure ) will contribute to the reduction in ROS and cell death. In addition, we also observe potential increased cardiovascular health risk due to increased predictions of in ammation. FYN, which is part of the SRC family kinases (which includes nine non-receptor tyrosine kinases discussed in the results), has been shown to be heavily involved with the cardiovascular system by decreasing ROS production and apoptosis [36]. Our analysis also agrees with what has been observed with the cardiovascular literature. It has been shown that knocking out FYN increases cardiac cell death and induces ROS production through NADPH Oxidase  (NOX4) signaling [36]. Others have shown FYN kinase inhibitors also inhibits nuclear factor erythroid  related factor  (NRF2) activity (which is an essential molecule for cardiac adaptive responses and protection) and enhances myocardial necrosis and death rate [39]. NRF2 is also known to be essential in sensing ROS and regulating protection against damaging changes to the redox balance [74,75]. This mechanism has been discovered to be heavily regulated by FYN activation phosphorylating NRF2 which in turn triggers  defense response to ROS [75]. Space radiation has previously been shown to induce ROS in tissue and negatively impact the host [76,77]. What is novel about our  nding is that the universal ROS impact that has classically been thought to impact all tissue does not seem to   with cells involved with the cardiovascular system. Although ROS should be initially activated in cardiovascular tissue after exposure to space radiation, this mechanism through FYN attempts to protect the cardiovascular system. As discussed above, in  normal response with other types of external damage causing oxidative stress on the cardiovascular system, it has been shown that FYN will be activated and act as  negative feedback regulator to protect the cardiac tissue [36]. This mechanism has not been previously considered as an internal protective countermeasure to the effects of space radiation on cardiac tissue. Here we propose that there is  protective negative feedback loop that allows FYN to inhibit the ROS activation that is triggered by space radiation (Figure ). Int. . Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 661 15 of 22 Although this seems to provide protection against  key player in space radiation damage to the cardiac tissue, other factors still seem to have  negative impact on the cardiovascular system that can increase risk of cardiovascular disease. To that end, we also observed  predicted activation of in ammation due to the key genes (Figure , Figure , and Figure ). It is well known that in ammation in cardiac tissue has been associated with cardiovascular disease [78]. It has also been shown that reduction of ROS through antioxidants can potentially elevate chronic in ammation in cardiac tissue [78]. Our data suggests that although FYN might be acting as  natural antioxidant to reduce ROS effects, this mechanism might not be enough to reduce the in ammation caused by space radiation which has the potential to increase risk of cardiovascular disease. From our previous studies, we have observed that miRNAs can be  key driver in response to the damage caused by the space environment [54]. We were able to predict the top 30 miRNAs that have potential to respond to space radiation in the cardiovascular system (Figure ). Surprisingly, 17 out 30 miRNAs predicted have been shown to be associated with heart failure and play  role in cardiovascular disease [73]. Three out of 30 miRNAs also overlap with our previously identi ed universal miRNA signature that we have shown to systemically impact an organism due to  space environment. This preliminary result indicates that we have potential candidates for the speci  component related to the cardiac tissue and space radiation. Currently, there is  lack of information for the role miRNAs in space radiation  effect on the cardiovascular system. Our  ndings warrant further investigations to determine the extent to which miRNAs impact FYN and ROS due to space radiation. We believe that the novel mechanism presented here for space radiation induced cardiovascular risk will impact the further development of space radiation risk models. We were able to directly link radiation ground studies to space ight and provide  rationale of how the cardiovascular system can help reduce ROS. We have shown through the power of NASA  GeneLab platform that novel  ndings can be produced from existing data from former studies. By creatively combing several datasets we have potential indication of the speci  space radiation component that astronauts are being exposed to at LEO on the ISS. It has been previously thought that protons comprise the majority of ions that astronauts are exposed to in LEO [16], but biological data have been lacking. Of course, further experiments have to be performed to determine whether these  ndings are true which can involve doing radiation ground experiments with HUVECs at . mGy ( comparable dose to the ISS for  days) and then once again comparing the gene expression changes to the dataset used here. The power of this type of analysis with GeneLab datasets allows for future guidance for space biology related experiments. In addition, we were able to uncover  novel mechanism underlying space radiation  impact on the cardiovascular system. Although this study was done purely based on omics data, we believe that we have shown the power of using purely in silico methods to provide novel data. In addition, this manuscript demonstrates that GeneLab data can be utilized to give important hints to plan expensive space and accelerator experiments very carefully and not to be parsimonious when including the relevant controls and baselines. Further studies should be implemented to validate the  ndings reported here and potentially develop countermeasures for cardiovascular risk due space ight. . Materials and Methods ..",

For 56Fe, the following time-points were used for transcriptomic analysis:  day ( = ),  days ( = ),  days ( = ), 14 days ( = ), and 28 days ( = ). For both experiments cardiomyocytes were also isolated from  Gy sham at the following time-points and data was pooled between all time-points for the controls:  day ( = ) and  days ( = ). All cardiomyocytes were isolated by microdissection from tissue dissections in order to remove other cell types. One space ight study was used that  ew HUVECs to the ISS and the cells were exposed to space environment in vitro under standard conditions for  days before the cells were preserved in RNAlater [44]. The ground controls used for this study are     controls that were grown on Earth with identical conditions compared to the cells on the ISS. .. Transcriptomic Analysis The available transcriptomic data for tissues from GLDS-52, -109, and -117 datasets were previously performed on different versions of Affymetrix platforms. Due to the incompatibility and batch issues of processed data from these different platforms, all datasets were analyzed independently and the processed data was compared across all tissues. Datasets were background adjusted and quantile normalized using RMAExpress [79]. The probes from the pre-processed data were median collapsed using GenePattern [80]. All the data for each tissue/dataset was imported into MultiExperiment Viewer [81] and statistically signi cant genes was determined by ANOVA analysis between all conditions for GLDS-109 and -117, and  -value  .05 and -test with  -value for GLDS-52. The number of signi cant genes was used for the rest the analysis for the higher-order analysis. Pathway analysis and subsequent predictions in each tissue were done using the statistically signi cant genes with  fold-change  . (or  .) comparing  ight conditions versus ground controls or irradiated samples vs. unirradiated samples for ground experiments. Using  .-fold-change cutoff allowed us to determine the impact of how major pathways were being regulated that would not be apparent with larger fold-change cutoffs. It was shown in the literature that larger fold-change values used for Omics data will signi cantly reduce useful biological data that becomes apparent when using lower fold-change cutoffs [82,83]. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems) was used to predict statistically signi cant activation or inhibition of upstream regulators, canonical pathways, biofunctions, and toxic functions using activation -score statistics ( , activated or  , inhibited) [84]. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was done using the C2, C5, and Hallmarks gene sets with  FDR  .05 from the entire list of genes and additional leading edge analysis was performed as described by Subramanian et al. [46]. All heat maps and principal component analysis (PCA) plots were generated using packages available through  (pheatmap for heat maps and scatterplot3d for PCA plots). .. Determination of Key Genes/Drivers We used  previously established unbiased systems biology method to determine key genes/drivers [54,56,57,59,60] for each tissue. Brie , the standard method we have developed in the past to determine key genes was done by determining the overlapping genes involved in the predictions made through IPA  upstream regulators, canonical pathways, biofunctions, and GSEA gene sets (C2, C5, and Hallmarks gene sets). The common genes identi ed through these statistically signi cant predictions can be thought of as the central drivers for the experiment being studied, since the absence of the genes will make these predictions null. In some cases, these overlaps result in either no key genes or  very low number of genes. If this occurs, we adjust the pathway predictions involved with the gene overlaps. For the key genes determined here, we were forced to show the overlapping genes that were only involved with the GSEA Hallmarks Gene Set analysis with the IPA predictions. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2019, 20, 661 17 of 22 To determine the key gene, which has the highest number of connections and can be thought of as the central hub for the set of key genes, we utilized IPA to de ne the total number of connections between all the key genes. Next, we plotted the genes using the radial plot tool which places the most connected gene in the center of the plot. Previous work involving similar statistically identi ed key genes provided experimental validation for this methodology using Western blots, qPCR, and other functional assays [56,60]. .. MicroRNA (miRNA) Predictions Through the use of  Cytoscape [70] plug-in called ClueGo [71], we were able to predict miRNAs based on the key genes determined. This involved entering all key genes determined in ClueGo and allowing the software to determine the top 30 miRNAs that were signi cantly regulated and connected to the key genes. No directionality of the key genes was required for the results.

      "subject": "Space radiation has recently been considered a risk factor for astronauts’ cardiac health. As an example, for the case of how to query and identify datasets within NASA’s GeneLab database and demonstrate the database utility, we used an unbiased systems biology method for identifying key genes/drivers for the contribution of space radiation on the cardiovascular system. This knowledge can contribute to designing appropriate experiments targeting these specific pathways. Microarray data from cardiomyocytes of male C57BL/6 mice followed-up for 28 days after exposure to 900 mGy of 1 GeV proton or 150 mGy of 1 GeV/n 56Fe were compared to human endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured for 7 days on the International Space Station (ISS). We observed common molecular pathways between simulated space radiation and HUVECs flown on the ISS. The analysis suggests FYN is the central driver/hub for the cardiovascular response to space radiation: the known oxidative stress induced immediately following radiation would only be transient and would upregulate FYN, which in turn would reduce reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, protecting the cardiovascular system. The transcriptomic signature of exposure to protons was also much closer to the spaceflight signature than 56Fe’s signature. To our knowledge, this is the first time GeneLab datasets were utilized to provide potential biological indications that the majority of ions on the ISS are protons, clearly illustrating the power of omics analysis. More generally, this work also demonstrates how to combine animal radiation studies done on the ground and spaceflight studies to evaluate human risk in space.",

Bassham1,,*  Department of Genetics, Development and Cell Biology, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA,  Interdepartmental Genetics Program, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA,  Plant Sciences Institute, Iowa State University, Ames, IA, USA The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is  dynamic organelle that functions as  relay station for receiving endocytosed cargo, directing secretory cargo, and traf cking to the vacuole. TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1) is  large, TGN-localized, coiled-coil protein that associates with the membrane fusion protein SYP41,  target SNARE, and is required for ef cient protein traf cking to the vacuole. Here, we show that  tno1 mutant has auxin transport-related defects. Mutant roots have delayed lateral root emergence, decreased gravitropic bending of plant organs and increased sensitivity to the auxin analog ,-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and the natural auxin -indoleacetic acid. Auxin asymmetry at the tips of elongating stage II lateral roots was reduced in the tno1 mutant, suggesting  role for TNO1 in cellular auxin transport during lateral root emergence. During gravistimulation, tno1 roots exhibited delayed auxin transport from the columella to the basal epidermal cells. Endocytosis to the TGN was unaffected in the mutant, indicating that bulk endocytic defects are not responsible for the observed phenotypes. Together these studies demonstrate  role for TNO1 in mediating auxin responses during root development and gravistimulation, potentially through traf cking of auxin transport proteins. Keywords: auxin, trans-Golgi network, lateral root, gravitropism, tethering factor INTRODUCTION The trans-Golgi network (TGN) is  highly dynamic tubulo-vesicular organelle that matures from the two or three trans-most cisternae of the Golgi (Staehelin and Kang, 2008) and is crucial for endocytic, secretory and vacuolar tra cking routes in plant cells. TGN cisternae move rapidly inside the cell, dissociating from their associated Golgi and re-associating with  new Golgi stack (Staehelin and Kang, 2008; Kang, 2011; Uemura et al., 2014), and also contain distinct subdomains for various tra cking routes (Bassham et al., 2000; Chow et al., 2008; Gendre et al., 2011). The TGN functions as an early/recycling endosome (Dettmer et al., 2006; Viotti et al., 2010) that receives endocytosed cargo, including auxin transporters, plasma membrane receptors, and nutrient transporters (Russinova et al., 2004; Robatzek et al., 2006; Dhonukshe et al., 2007; Takano et al., 2010; Barberon et al., 2011), and recycles it back to the plasma membrane or to the vacuole for degradation. The TGN plays  crucial role in tra cking of biosynthetic tra  to the vacuole (Reyes et al., 2011). It also directs secretory cargo, including plasma membrane proteins and cell wall polysaccharides, to the cell surface, potentially via mobile secretory vesicle clusters that fuse with the plasma membrane (Toyooka et al., 2009; Gendre et al., 2014). The position of the TGN at Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org  November 2015 | Volume  | Article\n\nRoy and Bassham TNO1 is required for gravitropism and LR emergence the junction of the endocytic, vacuolar, and secretory pathways renders it important in regulating transport of key molecules and mediating cellular responses to the environment (Park and Jurgens, 2011; Reyes et al., 2011; Contento and Bassham, 2012). High transport  delity is needed to prevent mis-sorting of cargo during vesicle tra cking. This requires membrane fusion proteins termed soluble -ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptors (SNAREs; Risselada and Grubmuller, 2012). SNAREs can be broadly classi ed as target SNARES (-SNAREs) or vesicle SNAREs (-SNAREs) depending on their location, or as  or -SNAREs based on the core amino acid in the heptad repeat of the SNARE motif (Fasshauer et al., 1998). The interaction between  -SNARE on  vesicle and -SNAREs on its target membrane leads to membrane fusion via formation of  tetrameric trans-SNARE complex (McNew et al., 2000; Lipka et al., 2007; Kim and Brandizzi, 2012; Risselada and Grubmuller, 2012). Usually, three  SNAREs (Qa, Qb, and Qc) form  -SNARE complex and an -SNARE acts as the -SNARE. This interaction of SNAREs helps to overcome the thermodynamically unfavorable event of fusion of two hydrophobic lipid bilayers (Risselada and Grubmuller, 2012; Shi et al., 2012), enabling deposition of cargo into the target organelle. Proteins known as tethering factors aid in bringing membranes together and promoting SNARE interaction or actively stimulating trans-SNARE complex formation (Cai et al., 2007). Tethering factors thus increase vesicular tra cking  ciency (Sztul and Lupashin, 2009; Chia and Gleeson, 2011; Hong and Lev, 2014) and are either homodimeric long coiled-coil proteins or multisubunit tethering complexes (Markgraf et al., 2007; Hong and Lev, 2014). It was recently proposed that coiled- coil tethers simultaneously use their multiple coiled-coil domains to engage distinct SNAREs and promote SNARE complex assembly (Grabski et al., 2012). Spatiotemporal regulation of tra cking steps in the cell also requires  family of small GTPases called Rabs which then recruit downstream  ectors (Stenmark, 2009). Tethers can act as Rab  ectors by binding SNAREs or can function as GTP exchange factors (GEFs) for Rabs (Markgraf et al., 2007; Sztul and Lupashin, 2009; Hong and Lev, 2014). Many SNAREs and tethering factors exist in Arabidopsis thaliana, with di erent localizations re ecting their specialized roles (Fujimoto and Ueda, 2012). The TGN-localized SYP4 (41/42/43) SNARE family (Bassham et al., 2000; Uemura et al., 2012) is responsible for maintaining Golgi/TGN morphology and regulating secretory and vacuolar tra cking (Uemura et al., 2012). Another TGN SNARE, SYP61, interacts with SYP41 and helps to direct tra  to the plasma membrane (Drakakaki et al., 2012), with  role in mediating stress responses (Zhu et al., 2002). Recently, TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1),  large coiled-coil protein localized to the TGN, was identi ed as  SYP41 interactor (Kim and Bassham, 2011) and was hypothesized to be  tethering factor. Mutant plants lacking TNO1 partially mis-sort vacuolar cargo and mis-localize SYP61, suggesting decreased tra cking  delity, while also showing hypersensitivity to salt and osmotic stress and displaying altered TGN dynamics (Kim and Bassham, 2011). SYP42 and SYP43 play  role in root gravitropism, most likely via regulation of the localization of the auxin  ux transporters PIN-FORMED  (PIN1) and PIN2 (Uemura et al., 2012). Additionally, other proteins involved in auxin transport, such as the AUXIN1/LIKE-AUX1 (AUX1/LAX) family of auxin in ux transporters and -glycoprotein (PGP) proteins of the ATP- binding cassette transporter family, are localized via the SNAREs and TGN activity (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008; Rakusov  et al., 2015). Many of the auxin transporters undergo constitutive endocytosis, cycling between the recycling endosome/TGN and the plasma membrane, or are targeted for vacuolar degradation to maintain steady-state levels (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008; Grunewald and Friml, 2010). Defects in TGN dynamics can, therefore, hamper recycling of these transporters and thus  ect directional transport of auxin, which is critical for plant development (Grunewald and Friml, 2010). Given the potential links between TGN-mediated protein tra cking and auxin transporters, we investigated auxin responses in the tno1 mutant during root development. Loss of TNO1 delayed lateral root (LR) emergence and decreased root and hypocotyl gravitropic bending. Additionally, tno1 roots failed to display characteristic asymmetry visualized with the auxin response marker DR5rev:GFP at the LR tips as well as after gravistimulation. Thus, TNO1 functions in auxin-mediated root development and response to gravity. MATERIALS AND METHODS Plant Material and Growth Conditions The . thaliana seed stocks used in this study have been previously described: Col- (wild-type, WT), tno1 knockout mutant (SALK_112503; Kim and Bassham, 2011), complemented tno1 mutant (Kim and Bassham, 2011), and DR5rev:GFP (Ottenschlager et al., 2003). Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in 33% bleach, .% (/) Triton -100 for 20 min, rinsed  ve times with sterile water and kept in the dark at   for at least  days. Arabidopsis plants were grown at 22  in long-day conditions (16  light) in soil or on .25  or . solid Murashige Skoog (MS) medium (MS vitamin and salt mixture, Caisson, MSPA0910) with % sucrose, . mM MES (pH .), and .% (/) phytoblend agar (Caisson, PTP01). Gravitropism Assays The hypocotyl gravitropism assay was modi ed from Stanga et al. (2009). Seeds were plated on . MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) containing % sucrose in square plates and kept vertically oriented in the dark. After  days, the plates were rotated 90 for gravistimulation. Pictures were acquired using  Canon Rebel XTS camera in  dark room with  green  lter over the  ash to prevent phototropic curvature of the hypocotyl toward the camera  ash. Zero-hour images of each seedling were compared to later time point images of the same seedling using Image  (Schneider et al., 2012) to determine bending angles. For root gravitropic assays, sterilized seeds were mixed with molten growth medium just before solidi cation and Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org  November 2015 | Volume  | Article\n\nRoy and Bassham TNO1 is required for gravitropism and LR emergence poured into square plates (Stanga et al., 2009). After  days of vertical growth the seedlings were gravistimulated by rotating the plate by 90 . Pictures were taken  and 24  after gravistimulation and analyzed using Image  to assess gravitropic curvature. For root and hypocotyl gravitropic rescue assays, the roots of -day-old vertically grown seedlings were overlaid with media containing either 100 nM -napthylacetic acid (-NAA; Sigma Aldrich, N0640), 30 nM -indoleacetic acid (IAA; Sigma  Aldrich, I2886), or 30 nM ,-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (,-; Gibco, 11215), followed by gravistimulation. Pictures of roots and hypocotyls after 12  were compared to - images using Image . For all assays, at least three biological replicates were performed, with 15 20 seedlings per replicate. LR Density Analysis To determine the density of emerging LRs, sterilized Arabidopsis seeds were plated on .25  MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) containing % sucrose and grown vertically. After 10 days, the number of LRs emerging from the primary root were counted and divided by the root length to obtain LR density. For determination of LR primordia density, -day-old roots were cleared with .% bleach for 10 min and visualized with an Olympus IX-71 inverted microscope. To assess rescue of LR emergence, -day-old seedlings were transferred to medium containing 100 nM -NAA or    IAA in the dark (to prevent photo-degradation). After  additional days, the number of emergent LRs was scored. For each analysis, three independent biological replicates were performed with 15 20 seedlings per replicate. Root Length Inhibition Assays Seedlings were grown on . MS medium (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) with % sucrose for  days. They were then transferred to media containing either ,-, IAA, -NAA, - -naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA; Naptalam, Sigma Aldrich, 33371), -napthoxyacetic acid (-NOA; Sigma Aldrich, 255416) at the concentrations indicated, or solvent controls [dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or ethanol], and the position of the root tip was marked. Each plate contained all three genotypes (WT, tno1 mutant, and complemented lines) to compensate for possible  ects of inter-plate variation. After  days, pictures were acquired and the length from the marked root tip position was measured using ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012). Root elongation in the presence of the tested chemicals was compared with solvent controls and expressed as percent decrease in root length. At least three biological replicates with  minimum of 20 seedlings per replicate were conducted for each treatment. Analysis of Auxin Response Distribution tno1 plants expressing DR5rev:GFP were generated by crossing tno1 (Kim and Bassham, 2011) with DR5rev:GFP lines (Ottenschlager et al., 2003).

The root tips were visualized using  Leica SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Confocal and Multiphoton facility, using  63  oil immersion objective lens and excitation and emission wavelengths of 558 and 734 nm. Images were acquired under identical conditions for both genotypes with equal exposure, scan frequency and line average settings. total of 15 seedlings from at least three independent replicates were analyzed for each treatment and genotype. RESULTS TNO1 Mediates LR Emergence in an Auxin-dependent Manner Auxin signaling pathways are integral to LR development during root architecture establishment (Lavenus et al., 2013). Polar auxin transport mediates emergence of LRs from the primary axis, and several auxin transport mutants display slow rates of emergence (Hobbie and Estelle, 1995; Ruegger et al., 1997). The SYP4 family of SNAREs is thought to be involved in directional auxin transport (Uemura et al., 2012), hence we tested whether the SYP41-interacting protein TNO1 may also be required for such processes. We hypothesized that if the tno1 mutant has defects in auxin transport or responses, visible phenotypes such as changes Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org  November 2015 | Volume  | Article\n\nRoy and Bassham TNO1 is required for gravitropism and LR emergence in LR emergence would be evident. Emergent LR densities were signi cantly lower ( < .05) in tno1 seedlings after 10 days of growth on .25  MS medium (Dubrovsky and Forde, 2012). Mutant lines expressing transgenic TNO1 under the control of its native promoter, termed complemented lines (Kim and Bassham, 2011), were similar to WT seedlings (Figures 1A,). Since the major source of auxin in the root in the  rst 10 days after germination is transport from the leaves (Hobbie and Estelle, 1995; Ljung et al., 2001), one possible reason for this defect may be that auxin  ux is reduced in tno1, leading to suboptimal auxin levels in the root and impairing LR emergence. To con rm that the delayed emergence was not due to an arrest or delay in LR initiation, the number of LR primordia was evaluated in the mutant roots. The LR primordia density of tno1 roots was equivalent to that of WT and complemented lines (Figure 1C), suggesting that LR initiation events were normal in tno1. The lipophilic auxin -NAA has been shown to rescue LR defects in the auxin transport mutant aux1 (Marchant et al., 2002). Natural auxin (IAA) treatment also rescues LR emergence in dark conditions (Reed et al., 1998). To test whether the emergence defect may be due to defects in auxin transport and hence reduced root auxin levels, LR emergence in the presence of -NAA (Murashige and Skoog, 1962; Marchant et al., 2002) or IAA in the dark (Reed et al., 1998) was assessed. Five-day-old seedlings were transferred to medium containing 100 nM NAA or    IAA, and LR density was analyzed after  days of growth. The LR density of tno1 resembled that of WT and complemented lines in the presence of either auxin (Figure 1D), indicating that exogenous auxins can rescue the emergent LR defect in tno1 roots. Therefore, TNO1 in uences the temporal control of LR emergence from the primary root. TNO1 is Required for Gravitropic Bending We further examined  possible role for TNO1 in plant auxin responses by investigating gravitropism. Gravitropism involves the bending of  plant organ in response to its change in orientation with respect to gravity (gravistimulation). Gravitropic bending of organs upon gravistimulation is aided by  readjustment of auxin  ow. Since  number of proteins involved in gravitropic curvature are recycled and tra cked via the TGN (Strohm et al., 2012), this organelle is critical for regulating downstream events that in uence gravitropic plant organ bending. We, therefore, hypothesized that loss of TNO1 might  ect dynamics at the TGN and thus lead to  change in the gravitropic bending response. To test this hypothesis, the gravitropic response of WT and tno1 mutant hypocotyls and roots was assessed. The tno1 mutant FIGURE  | Loss of TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein (TNO1) function delays lateral root emergence in an auxin-dependent fashion.

Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org  November 2015 | Volume  | Article\n\nRoy and Bassham TNO1 is required for gravitropism and LR emergence hypocotyls (Figure 2A) and roots (Figure 2B) showed delayed bending, and the angle of curvature at di erent time points was signi cantly lower ( < .05) than that of WT or complemented seedlings. This suggests that the loss of TNO1 causes  delay in the gravitropic bending of Arabidopsis roots and hypocotyls. Mutant roots and hypocotyls have  similar length to WT under normal growth conditions (Kim and Bassham, 2011), suggesting that the defect in gravitropism is not due to defective growth. The gravitropic bending response requires  reprogramming of auxin  ow inside the shoot and root (Tanaka et al., 2006; Strohm et al., 2012), raising the possibility that the slower bending rate observed in tno1 could be due to changes in auxin  ow. We hypothesized that if the gravitropic phenotype in tno1 mutants is due to defect() in auxin transport, it may be rescued by exogenous auxin application. To test this idea, we used the membrane-permeable auxin -NAA, which has been previously used to rescue gravitropic root bending defects in mutants defective in auxin transport (Marchant et al., 1999), the natural auxin IAA, and the in ux-speci  auxin ,-. Following auxin treatments, the bending angles of tno1 roots were not signi cantly di erent ( > .) from the bending angles of the WT and complemented lines (Figure 2C), indicating rescue of the gravitropic bending defect by exogenous auxin. The ,- treatment led to an overall reduction of bending angles as has been previously reported (Surpin et al., 2005) but there were no signi cant di erences between WT and mutant. Similarly, hypocotyl bending was also rescued after  12- treatment with either IAA or -NAA (Figure 2D), con rming that the gravitropic defect in tno1 mutants is most likely due to auxin- related defects. ,- did not rescue the gravitropic defect in the mutant hypocotyls, with bending angles signi cantly lower than WT and complemented lines; this is consistent with previous reports demonstrating an  ect of ,- on gravitropism in roots but not in hypocotyls (Surpin et al., 2005). The tno1 mutant FIGURE  | TNO1 mediates gravitropic bending by an auxin dependent mechanism. () Hypocotyl bending of WT, KO and COM hypocotyls after gravistimulation.

Auxin analogs and transport inhibitors are important tools to uncover defects in auxin transport pathways. The auxin analog ,- is an in ux-speci  substrate while -NAA is an  ux-speci  substrate (Delbarre et al., 1996). The auxin transport inhibitor NPA interferes with auxin  ux while -NOA interferes with auxin in ux and inhibits AUX1 (Thomson et al., 1973; Sussman and Goldsmith, 1981; Yang et al., 2006). To determine the  ect of these inhibitors on the tno1 mutant, their  ects on root growth were assessed. We found that tno1 roots were signi cantly ( < .05) more sensitive to 30 nM ,- than WT or complemented roots (Figure 3A). This result is consistent with our observation of the failure of ,- to rescue the gravitropic defect of mutant hypocotyls. One possible explanation for this sensitivity is that in ux routes are altered in the tno1 mutant, which led us to test the  ect of blocking auxin in ux with -NOA. Mutant roots showed similar sensitivity to WT and complemented lines across  range of concentrations of -NOA (Figure 3B), suggesting that blocking auxin in ux  ects the tno1 mutant to the same extent as wild-type. -NOA has  characteristic protective  ect against root growth inhibition by ,- (Parry et al., 2001); we, therefore, tested whether -NOA could rescue the root growth inhibition of mutant roots by ,- to comparable levels as in the WT and complemented lines. Seedlings were transferred to medium containing 30 nM ,-  and 10   -NOA. The WT and complemented lines showed  signi cantly lower inhibition of root length than the mutants ( < .05), indicating that when auxin in ux is blocked, tno1 mutants still have enhanced sensitivity to ,- (Figure 3C). To determine whether the sensitivity to ,- is also seen with other auxins, root growth inhibition on 40 nM IAA in the dark was assessed. tno1 mutant roots are indeed more sensitive to IAA ( < .05) than WT or complemented lines (Figure 3D). By contrast, treatment with . of the membrane-permeable NAA inhibited the growth of tno1 to  similar extent as WT and complemented plants (Figure 3E). Since ,- and IAA are in ux-speci  substrates and NAA is not, the results are consistent with  possible defect in FIGURE  | tno1 roots show increased sensitivity to ,- and IAA.

Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org  November 2015 | Volume  | Article\n\nRoy and Bassham TNO1 is required for gravitropism and LR emergence auxin in ux pathways in tno1. tno1, WT, and complemented plants had similar responses to NPA treatment (Figure 3F), suggesting that the auxin  ux pathway is una ected in tno1. TNO1 Helps Mediate Auxin Responses during LR Elongation Lateral roots emerge perpendicular to the primary root and gradually start bending rootwards. Recently emerged LRs, which lack an elongation zone (stage  LR) gradually transition into stage II LRs, de ned by an elongation zone and asymmetric growth of the upper and lower epidermal cell  les (Rosquete et al., 2013). The di erential growth peaks in the stage II LRs are due to asymmetric auxin distribution, which in turn is dependent on auxin transport mechanisms. Stage II LRs are thus de ned by  characteristic asymmetric distribution of auxin response, which results in di erential cellular elongation and downward root growth. This asymmetric auxin  ux at the LR tip is caused by the speci  activity and distribution of auxin transporters (Rosquete et al., 2013). The asymmetric auxin distribution pattern diminishes signi cantly as the LRs mature to Stage III and begin growing parallel to the primary root. It was reported that on average more than 75% of stage II LRs in WT plants display asymmetric distribution of auxin responses at LR tips (Rosquete et al., 2013), visualized by the pattern of DR5rev:GFP expression (Friml et al., 2003). Since TNO1 is linked to LR emergence by  possible auxin-dependent mechanism, we hypothesized that asymmetric auxin transport or response is defective in tno1 LRs. Hence, the percentage of LRs showing asymmetric auxin responses in stage II tno1 LR tips would be lower compared to WT (or complemented) root tips. To test this, the percentage of stage II LRs with auxin response asymmetry in WT and tno1 background lines expressing DR5rev:GFP was determined by confocal microscopy. 40% of tno1 stage II LRs displayed auxin asymmetry at the LR tip compared to 80% in WT stage II LRs (Figures 4A,). Thus, tno1 roots are defective in establishing the correct pattern of auxin response during LR development. This defect could explain the lower emergent LR density observed in tno1 compared to WT, since  disruption of auxin  ow or establishment of asymmetry would prevent LR emergence. TNO1 Facilitates Shootward Auxin Response during Root Bending Normally, gravitropic bending of the primary root leads to an eventual return of the root tip toward the gravity vector. This occurs via  cascade of signals leading to asymmetric auxin  ow from the columella cells to the lateral rootcap cells and eventually shootward through the epidermal and cortical cells (moving toward the root shoot junction). During this process, auxin accumulates on the lower side of the root, leading to growth inhibition, while the top of the root continues to elongate, thus resulting in downward root bending (Ottenschlager et al., 2003; Kleine-Vehn et al., 2010; Baldwin et al., 2012). Since tno1 roots are defective in gravitropic bending FIGURE  | TNO1 helps mediate auxin response asymmetry at lateral root (LR) tips. () Representative confocal images of stage II LR tips of WT and tno1 expressing the auxin-responsive DR5rev:GFP reporter. Yellow arrowheads indicate asymmetry of the auxin reporter GFP expression.

(Figure ) and the frequency of LR tips displaying auxin response asymmetry is lower than in WT LRs (Figure ), we hypothesized that the defect in root bending could be due to  decrease in shootward transport of auxin from the columella to the lateral rootcap cells and on to the distal elongation zone. To test this hypothesis, vertical plate-grown WT and tno1 seedlings expressing DR5rev:GFP were gravistimulated by rotating the plates by 90 . Confocal images were acquired before gravistimulation and subsequently at , , and 12  after gravistimulation for both WT and tno1 root tips (Figures 5A ). In the WT background, GFP  uorescence progressed shootward from the columella toward the lateral rootcap and epidermal cells of the lower side of the root. Conversely, the shootward appearance of  uorescence in tno1 was severely inhibited and failed to reach WT levels (arrowheads in Figures 5B ).

This ratio was signi cantly higher for WT roots than for tno1 mutants at all time-points, suggesting  stronger response in WT than in the mutants (Figure 5E). This in turn implies that the defect in gravitropic bending in tno1 mutants may be due to  decrease in auxin transport, or  di erence in auxin response, from the columella to the lateral rootcap and epidermal cells on the lower side of the gravistimulated root. Such  defect could explain the reduced bending observed in tno1 roots. Since auxin asymmetry within LR tips has been suggested to occur by  similar mechanism (Rosquete et al., 2013), this could also explain the lower percentage of stage II LRs displaying auxin response asymmetry in tno1. TNO1 is not Required for Bulk Endocytosis Auxin transporters such as the PIN proteins are continuously endocytosed to the TGN and recycled back to the plasma membrane to maintain an appropriate density, thus allowing steady auxin  ux through plant cells (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008; Friml, 2010). Defects in endocytosis and components Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org  November 2015 | Volume  | Article\n\nRoy and Bassham TNO1 is required for gravitropism and LR emergence involved in the endocytic route to the TGN can, therefore, cause  defect in auxin transport pathways. Since tno1 mutants show defects in TGN dynamics (Kim and Bassham, 2011) and display auxin-related defects, we hypothesized that loss of TNO1 might alter endocytic routes and/or arrival of cargo at the TGN. This in turn would manifest in altered auxin transporter tra cking dynamics, and subsequently alter auxin responses. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed endocytosis in root epidermal cells using the lipophilic styryl dye FM4-64, which is endocytosed and labels early endosomes. To capture early endocytic events, roots of -day-old seedlings were stained with    FM4-64 for  min and then washed twice for 30  each time in MS medium. Both WT and tno1 root cells showed similar endosome labeling patterns (Figure 6A, yellow arrowheads), suggesting that bulk endocytic uptake is normal in tno1 roots. To con rm that bulk endocytosis was una ected and that endocytic vesicles are delivered normally to the TGN in the mutant, the incorporation of FM4-64 into BFA bodies was assessed. The fungal toxin BFA causes aggregation of the TGN and TGN-derived endosomes to form BFA bodies (Geldner et al., 2001; Dettmer et al., 2006; Lam et al., 2009). BFA body formation is delayed in tno1 cotyledons but occurs at similar rates in root cells of WT and tno1 mutants (Kim and Bassham, 2011). It was hypothesized that if tno1 has defects in the delivery of endocytosed material to the TGN, then FM4- 64 labeling of BFA bodies in tno1 roots would be reduced compared with WT roots.

Thus, loss of TNO1 does not  ect bulk endocytosis and membrane  ow from the plasma membrane to the TGN in root cells. DISCUSSION Auxin  ow in plants is an important determinant of root architecture and tropic bending such as gravitropism. The polar transport of auxin depends on the speci  localization of auxin transporters, which in turn is dependent on the cellular tra cking machinery. The TGN is an important organelle controlling vesicle tra cking, with the presence of multiple proteins that aid the tra cking of cargoes such as auxin transporters. In this study we have demonstrated  role for  putative tethering factor localized at the TGN in  cient gravitropic bending and LR emergence, possibly by  ecting auxin transport. TNO1 may Regulate Gravitropic Responses through Traf cking of Auxin Transporters Auxin  ows in  polar manner from the shoot to the root tip, via the vasculature, and then back through the cortical and epidermal cell layers shootward. This polar transport is dependent on the polar localization of auxin transporters to plasma membranes, via tra cking pathways that achieve correct subcellular distribution (Kleine-Vehn and Friml, 2008). Auxin transporters undergo endocytic recycling from the plasma membrane as well as being targeted to new plasma membrane domains via the TGN (Kleine- Vehn and Friml, 2008). This enables  plant to respond to environmental cues and adjust its growth pattern accordingly. For example, during the bending of roots upon gravistimulation, an accumulation of auxin in the epidermal layer of the elongation zone in the lower half of the root is required to facilitate the bending process (Tanaka et al., 2006; Peer et al., 2011). This occurs by the relocalization of auxin transporters, AUX1 in the columella and lateral rootcap and AUX1 and PIN2 in the epidermal cells (Strohm et al., 2012). The resulting readjustment of auxin  ow from the columella via the lateral rootcap cell to the epidermal cells in the root elongation zone leads to di erential growth (Ottenschlager et al., 2003). Since tno1 has defects in intracellular tra cking and TGN dynamics (Kim and Bassham, 2011), we hypothesize that these may hinder auxin transport pathways due to change() in tra cking of auxin transporter(). Phenotypic characterization of gravitropic responses in tno1 roots and hypocotyls showed that these mutants have  decreased angle of bending upon gravistimulation. Pharmacological studies with auxin transport inhibitors and exogenous auxin analogs suggest that altered auxin pathways are likely to be the underlying cause of this defect. The gravitropic bending defect in tno1 Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org  November 2015 | Volume  | Article\n\nRoy and Bassham TNO1 is required for gravitropism and LR emergence roots and hypocotyls can be rescued by exogenous application of -NAA and IAA, perhaps by overriding endogenous auxin levels and routes of polar auxin transport, thus restoring auxin responses. Growth of tno1 roots is hypersensitive to ,- and IAA but not to the  ux-speci  substrate -NAA or the  ux blocker NPA, raising the possibility that the auxin in ux pathway might be defective while auxin  ux is normal. Although blocking auxin in ux with -NOA does not result in large di erences in root elongation between the tno1 mutant and WT, the sensitivity to ,- in the presence of -NOA is still higher for the tno1 mutant roots than the WT and complemented lines. This, coupled with the inability of ,- to rescue the gravitropic bending defect of mutant hypocotyls, may suggest altered responses to the in ux-speci  substrate ,-. Additionally, the delayed progression of DR5rev:GFP expression in epidermal cells of gravistimulated tno1 roots compared to WT roots suggests that auxin  ow from the columella to the epidermis (via the lateral rootcap cells) may be reduced in tno1 roots. Based on these results, we hypothesize that altered auxin in ux capacity underlies the gravitropic defects in tno1. Given the role of TNO1, this could occur through altered tra cking of auxin in ux carrier(). However, it is also possible that the sensitivity to ,- in the tno1 mutant is due to di erences in auxin signaling, feedback or response, since it is known that the auxin sensing mechanism is complex and varies for di erent kinds of auxins (Calder  Villalobos et al., 2012). Since auxin transporters are tra cked via endocytosis (Kleine- Vehn and Friml, 2008), we hypothesized that TNO1 may  ect endocytosis from the plasma membrane to the TGN/early endosomes and hence alter transporter tra cking dynamics. Bulk uptake and arrival of  general endocytosis marker at the TGN was una ected in the tno1 mutant and thus the auxin-related defects do not appear to be due to defects in bulk endocytosis. However, it is possible that TNO1 is required for the polar targeting of  particular subset of auxin transporter(), either as they are newly synthesized or during the recycling process for membrane relocalization. Further detailed characterization of the behavior of such proteins in tno1 cells will help distinguish between these hypotheses. The polar sorting of auxin transporters in plant cells is highly complex and our understanding of how the SNARE machinery might regulate this polarity is incomplete. Vacuolar SNAREs have been shown to play  role in maintaining auxin maxima and localization of the auxin  ux carrier PIN1 in the leaf primordium, thereby regulating leaf vasculature (Shirakawa et al., 2009). The SYP4 family of Qa SNAREs  ects auxin distribution, root gravitropism, and the intracellular tra cking of the PIN2 transporter to the vacuole for degradation (Uemura et al., 2012). Since TNO1 associates with the SNARE machinery at the TGN, and its loss causes  mis-localization of SYP61 as well as vacuolar sorting defects (Kim and Bassham, 2011), the SYP41/SYP61/VTI12 complex in conjunction with TNO1 may regulate auxin transport by  ecting auxin transporter tra cking and turnover. TNO1 Contributes to the Temporal Control of LR Emergence We have demonstrated that TNO1 is involved in LR emergence and generation of auxin response asymmetry in an emerging LR. LR development begins by division of LR founder cells (single or pairs of pericycle cells facing the xylem poles) in the primary root and subsequent formation of an auxin maximum and increased auxin responsiveness of the founder cells (De Smet et al., 2007; Dubrovsky et al., 2008; Peret et al., 2009). Auxin transport plays  crucial role in LR emergence, with both auxin in ux and  ux carriers being involved. The auxin in ux carrier AUX1 is important for loading auxin into the vascular system (Marchant et al., 2002) and aux1 mutants have an almost 50% reduction in LR number. Auxin in the endodermis and cortical cells induces another auxin in ux carrier, LAX3, which also facilitates LR emergence (Swarup et al., 2008). The concerted action of AUX1 and LAX3, with subsequent induction of expression of PIN3 in the cortex, leads to emergence of the LR from the primary root (Swarup and Peret, 2012; Peret et al., 2013). The LR emergence defects observed in tno1 are consistent with altered auxin transport due to disruption in the tra cking or targeting of auxin transporters. tno1 mutants have  signi cantly reduced percentage (40% vs. 80% in WT) of emergent Stage II LRs with asymmetric DR5rev:GFP expression, raising the possibility of auxin transport defect(). Since the action of PIN transporters plays  crucial role in establishing this asymmetric pattern of auxin activity in emergent LRs (Rosquete et al., 2013), TNO1 might  ect the tra cking of PIN transporters in the LR tip cells during this process. LR emergence occurs within the pericycle and involves degradation of the pectin-rich middle lamella, with subsequent cell separation to allow growth of the LR through multiple cell layers (Vilches-Barro and Maizel, 2014). Focused auxin  ow via transporters into the cortex and the epidermis causes an induction of expression of cell wall remodeling enzymes (Swarup et al., 2008; Peret et al., 2013). Secretory cargo, including various cell wall remodeling enzymes, tra cs via the Golgi and TGN toward the extracellular space (Foresti and Denecke, 2008; Toyooka et al., 2009; De Caroli et al., 2011), in  pathway potentially mediated by SYP61 (Drakakaki et al., 2012). Hence, it is possible that defects in the TGN, including the mis-localization of SYP61 seen in tno1, could also lead to disrupted secretion of cell wall remodeling enzymes, thus leading to slower LR emergence (Worden et al., 2012). The identi cation of  ectors directly associated with TNO1 may help elucidate its mechanism of action during these auxin-mediated processes. Since tethering factors can interact with Rabs (Markgraf et al., 2007), TNO1 could potentially indirectly  ect auxin transporter sorting by  ecting the Rab cycle or the function of Rab  ectors. Selective targeting of auxin transporters between the plasma membrane and the TGN could be defective in tno1 independent of the constitutive pathways that constantly recycle them between these membranes. Turnover of auxin transporters could also be reduced due to defective targeting to Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 10 November 2015 | Volume  | Article\n\nRoy and Bassham TNO1 is required for gravitropism and LR emergence the vacuole for degradation.

In small animals, such as in rats and mice, cyclic loading experiments are particularly challenging to perform in  precise manner due to the small size of the bones and di cult-to-eliminate machine compliance. Addressing this issue, we developed  precise method for ex vivo cyclic compressive loading of isolated mouse vertebral bodies. The method has three key characteristics: 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces of the tiny vertebrae; pivotable loading platens to ensure uniform contact and loading of specimen surfaces; and specimen-speci  micro-CT-based  nite element analysis to measure sti ness to prescribe force levels that produce the same speci ed level of strain for all test specimens. To demonstrate utility, we measured fatigue life for three groups ( =   per group) of L5 vertebrae of C57BL/6J male mice, comparing our new method against two methods commonly used in the literature. We found reduced scatter of the mechanical behavior for this new method compared to the literature methods. In particular, for  controlled level of strain, the standard deviation of the measured fatigue life was up to -fold lower for the new method (-ratio = .;  < .01). The improved precision for this new method for biomechanical testing of small-animal vertebrae may help elucidate aspects of bone quality. . Introduction  number of diseases, including osteoporosis (Bouxsein, 2003a; Saito and Marumo, 2010) and type II diabetes (Janghorbani et al., 2007; Vestergaard, 2007; Farr and Khosla, 2016; Rubin and Patsch, 2016), are thought to increase fracture risk due in part to deteriorated bone quality. That is, these diseases may result in detrimental changes to mechanical behavior that are not directly associated with reductions in bone mass (Hernandez and Keaveny, 2006). Concerns over possible changes in bone quality have also caused the FDA to require extensive pre-clinical animal testing on any new treatments (Mosekilde, 1995; Ominsky et al., 2011). In assessing bone quality, various mechanical properties can be measured (Hernandez and Keaveny, 2006; Turner and Burr, 1993; Fyhrie and Christiansen, 2015), typically sti ness, strength, toughness, and ductility. All these properties are obtained from monotonic loading. In addition, the response of bone to cyclic (repetitive) loading may be important for bone quality assessment if such loading produces unique failure mechanisms (.. slow crack growth, microdamage accumulation) that are not manifested in monotonic loading (Kruzic and Ritchie, 2008; Nalla et al., 2003). Bio- mechanical testing of any type is challenging to perform in  precise manner in small animals, such as in rats and mice, due to the small size of the bones and the inevitable machine-compliance  ects that are di cult to eliminate. Furthermore, for cyclic loading, loss of test spe- cimens during the experiment and the substantial variation in cyclic- loading responses both serve to reduce statistical power (Brouwers et al., 2009), which in turn can lead to inconclusive  ndings regarding the role of bone quality. As  result of these challenges, and because of the continuing in- terest in bone quality (Bouxsein, 2003b; Seeman and Delmas, 2006), there remains  need to re ne the experimental protocols for bio- mechanical testing of small-animal bone specimens, particularly for  Received  October 2018; Accepted 17 October 2018   Corresponding author at: 5124 Etcheverry Hall, Mailstop 1740, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-1740, USA. -mail address:  (..

Here, we report on  method for cyclic biomechanical testing of the mouse lumbar vertebra ex vivo that has improved pre- cision. This technique should help optimize statistical power in animal experiments, thus improving the ability of researchers to detect me- chanically relevant changes in bone quality due to aging, disease, or treatment, particularly for any situation in which samples sizes are limited in number. . Materials and methods We  rst present our new method in detail. Then, to demonstrate utility, we describe results from cyclic testing experiments for three groups ( =   per group) of L5 mouse vertebrae, comparing results for our new method (referred to as  KFEA method ) against two existing methods from the literature (referred to as  KEXP method  and  FMAX method ) (Brouwers et al., 2009; Caler and Carter, 1989; Bowman et al., 1998; Haddock et al., 2004; Lambers et al., 2013; McCubbrey et al., 1995). .. Animals Our experiments used L5 vertebrae obtained post-mortem from male C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Labs, Sacramento, CA) that were in the control groups of various previous studies (unpublished). All original studies, and this study, were approved by NASA Ames Research Center (ARC) Animal Care & Use Committee, and all experimental testing was conducted at NASA ARC. Ages of the mice ranged from 15 to 18 weeks. After sacri ce, the L1-S1 spinal segment was excised from the mouse with  scalpel via an anterior approach. The L5 vertebra was then se- parated by slicing through the adjacent intervertebral discs, gently cleaned of soft tissue, wrapped in saline-soaked gauze (Gibco PBS 1X, pH .), and stored at  20   until specimen preparation. .. Specimen preparation Obtaining true plano-parallel surfaces, which is di cult for such small specimens (Brouwers et al., 2009), is important to ensure full contact   and thus uniform compression   between the specimen surface and loading platens. If plano-parallel surfaces are not achieved, or if the loading platens are not perfectly parallel, local contact can occur over just part of the specimen surface. This introduces unwanted scatter in the mechanical response and perhaps also premature failure. Thus, we developed  detailed method for this aspect of the specimen preparation (Fig. ). Each vertebra was aligned inside  3D-printed (Stratasys Dimension SST 1200es, Eden Prairie, MN), disposable jig with  metal pin (diameter range .91 to .99 mm; length of 38 mm) (Fig. 1A) and secured with polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). The combined jig-bone construct was then positioned in  diamond-saw microtome (Leica SP1600 Saw Microtome, Wetzlar, Germany). Two parallel cuts were made on the cranial and caudal surfaces under con- stant irrigation to remove only the endplates (Fig. 1B), preserving the maximum amount of bone tissue. nal cut through the posterior pedicles released the vertebral body from the jig (Fig. 1C). .. Quantitative micro-CT imaging After machining, specimens were imaged using quantitative micro- CT ( CT 50, Scanco Medical AG, Bruttisellen, Switzerland) at  10-  voxel size (55 kV, 109  , 1000 projections per 180 , 500 ms integra- tion time) (Fig. ). Specimens were returned to the freezer after ima- ging. The micro-CT images of the whole specimen (cortical and trabe- cular compartments) were then analyzed for height, minimum tissue cross-sectional area (minimum value of tissue area at any cross-section, over all cross-sections), and total bone volume fraction (BV/TV) (Im- ageJ .51h, Java ..). Each specimen with cortices removed was then evaluated for trabecular micro-architecture (Scanco Evaluation Software v6.): trabecular bone volume fraction (Tb.BV/TV), number (Tb.), thickness (Tb.Th), and separation (Tb.Sp). .. Calculating specimen-speci  cyclic forces We used  force-control loading protocol, which allows both creep and damage to occur during cyclic loading. However, since the cyclic loading response of bone appears to be determined by the magnitude of the applied strain (as opposed to the magnitude of stress) (Nalla et al., 2003; Keaveny et al., 1994a; Keaveny et al., 1994b), our protocol re- quired us to calculate  specimen-speci  level of applied force that would result in the same level of initial apparent strain (calculated over the entire specimen) for all specimens. Cyclic loading in force control in this way should minimize scatter in the resulting fatigue life despite the heterogeneity in size, shape, and microarchitecture of the mouse ver- tebrae. This protocol required measuring the overall vertebral sti ness before starting the cyclic loading so that the prescribed apparent strains ( min and  max) could be converted into specimen-speci  levels of ap- plied force (Fmin and Fmax). However, experimentally measuring sti - ness for any bone is challenging due to di erent types of machine compliance errors, which can introduce both  xed and random errors (Odgaard et al., 1989; Odgaard and Linde, 1991; Keaveny et al., 1993; Keaveny et al., 1997). The  xed errors have implications for external validity, but otherwise do not compromise comparisons within any given experiment and are therefore oftentimes acceptable. However, large random errors compromise statistical power, particularly when sample sizes are < 10 per group. Thus, to circumvent any errors asso- ciated with machine compliance, we used  computationally derived sti ness (KFEA) that was obtained from specimen-speci , micro-CT- based, linearly elastic, voxel-based  nite element analysis. The models used 10-  sized cube voxels, and assumed  nominal value of 10 GPa for the tissue-level (voxel) elastic modulus for all specimens (see Appendix  for details). The specimen-speci  cyclic forces (Fmin; Eq. and Fmax; Eq. ) were then calculated for each specimen using KFEA, the specimen height () as measured from micro-CT, and two assumed nominal values of initial apparent elastic strain ( min = .05% and  max = .%): =     min FEA min () =     max FEA max () The assumed value of  max = .% was chosen empirically by trial and error based on earlier preliminary experiments on  mouse ver- tebral specimens. There, we found that the resulting Fmax value was approximately half of the directly measured ultimate force, which generally placed  specimen in the middle region of its fatigue life. The minimum initial elastic apparent strain value was chosen such that the resulting Fmin values were near  . .. Mechanical testing Within one week after imaging, specimens were thawed again to room temperature and prepared for cyclic loading in uniaxial com- pression to failure. The vertebral body was positioned onto the center of the lower platen of the material testing device (TA ElectroForce 3200, Eden Prairie, MN). Because obtaining perfectly parallel loading platens can be challenging, the upper platen comprised  spherically-seated platen on  lubricated ball-bearing which allows the platen surface to rotate and mate  ush with the sample surface to achieve uniform contact (Fig. ); with the pre-load in place, the set screws on the upper platen are locked. We used  compressive pre-load of  , and after the platen was locked room-temperature saline-solution (Gibco PBS 1X, pH .) was added to the bath until the specimen was fully submerged. The pre-load was then adjusted to the predetermined Fmin, and then sinusoidal cycles of compression between Fmin and Fmax were applied at .. Pendleton et al.

First, the force-displacement data were plotted for each loading-unloading cycle, from which sti ness was de ned as the secant sti ness, or range of force divided by range of displacement per cycle (Fig. 4A). Second, the apparent strain per cycle was plotted, and was separated into three curves representing total strain, creep strain, and damage strain (Fig. 4B).

Third, we plotted sti ness per cycle (Fig. 4C) to identify three variables: elastic sti ness of the specimen (Kelastic), sti ness at failure (Kf), and rate of sti ness de- gradation. Elastic sti ness was calculated as the average sti ness over   500 cycles centered about the maximum value of sti ness (Kmax), which typically occurred after  few thousand cycles of loading; the sti ness at failure was de ned as the sti ness measured at cycle Nf; and the rate of sti ness degradation ( / ) was calculated as the slope of  line that best   the middle 50% of points in the range be- tween Kmax and Kf. The  /  parameter re ected accumulation of fatigue damage, larger values indicating  more rapid accumulation of fatigue damage per loading cycle. In addition to these fatigue parameters, we also calculated an ef- fective elastic tissue modulus (Etissue, in GPa, Eq. ). This was calculated using both the experimental (Kelastic) and computational (KFEA) assess- ments of sti ness, scaling with respect to the assumed nominal value of the tissue-level modulus of 10 GPa in the  nite element analysis:     =            10 tissue elastic FEA () ..

For the  rst  KEXP method  (Brouwers et al., 2009; Caler and Carter, 1989; Bowman et al., 1998; Haddock et al., 2004; Lambers et al., 2013), instead of using the  nite element-derived value of sti ness (KFEA), the experimental measurement KEXP was used. Following literature protocol, KEXP was found by pre-loading the spe- cimen in compression to  , cycling between  and 10  20 times, and using the slope from the force-displacement curve of the 20th cycle. All other mechanical testing details were the same as for our new method except for two di erences in the KEXP method: ) the upper platen used was  rigid design (not adjustable); and ) the cyclic frequency was  Hz. However, fatigue behavior of bone has been shown to be un- altered for any loading frequency below 15 Hz (La erty, 1978; Yamamoto et al., 2006). For the second  FMAX method  (McCubbrey et al., 1995), Fmax was calculated using the measured strength of the adjacent L4 vertebra, obtained by monotonic compression to failure. The L5 strength was estimated as the product of the L4 strength and the ratio of minimum tissue cross-sectional areas (micro-CT) for the L4 and L5 vertebrae, and Fmax was then calculated as 50% of the L5 force (See Appendix , Table  for further details). All other mechanical testing details were the same as our new method. Fig. . Experimental test set-up for fatigue test shown with spherically-seated upper platen and specimen after preparation.

Statistical analysis The means and standard deviations of all outcome measurements were compared between the new method versus the two literature methods. To compare means,  one-way ANOVA was conducted, with  Tukey-Kramer post-hoc test applied to evaluate signi cant di erences (at   .05). To compare standard deviations,  Bartlett test was conducted. Standard deviations were considered signi cantly di erent with  -ratio > . and   .05. Also, linear regression was used to compare the relationships between maximum cyclic loading force and log of fatigue life (equivalent to  traditional - fatigue curve) be- tween the three methods. All statistics were performed using JMP (v13., SAS Institute). . Results Of all three methods tested, the new (KFEA) method produced the lowest variation in fatigue life. The mean value of the applied force was the same for all groups (22 ), but the standard deviation was lowest for the new (KFEA) method (   .77 ), -fold and -fold lower than the KEXP and FMAX methods (-ratio = .;  < .01; Fig. 5A), respectively. Because of these larger variations in applied force for the literature methods, the fatigue life displayed  negative - type relation with the loading force (R2 = .73 both literature methods) but there was no such correlation for the new method (R2 = .07; Fig. ). Instead, for the new method the fatigue life was approximately uniform across all specimens (. .), and its standard deviation was -fold and -fold lower than for the KEXP or FMAX methods, respectively (-ratio = .;  = .008; Fig. 5A). The new method also provided other measurements related to bone quality, both of which displayed high uniformity across the specimens: the  ective tissue elastic modulus, Etissue, was .83   .22 GPa and the strain to (cyclic) failure,  , was .20   .80%. Three additional observations were noteworthy. First, compared to the new method, the average fatigue life was lower for the KEXP method by 40.% ( = .002) whereas fatigue life did not di er for the FMAX method ( > .90; Fig. 5A). Second, the elastic sti ness measured from fatigue testing (Kelastic) was also lower for the KEXP method than the FMAX method by 42.% ( = .002), and than the new method by 44.% ( < .001); sti nesses for the FMAX and new methods were not di erent ( > .80; Fig. 5B). And third, the standard deviation for sti ness was lowest for the new method (-ratio = .53;  = .011; Fig. 5B) compared to the KEXP and FMAX method. The di erence in sti ness variation between FMAX and the new method, which both used the spherically-seated platen, shows that large variations in sti ness can still exist even with the use of  pivotable  xture, presumably due to variable degrees of machine compliance. . Discussion Our new method for cyclic loading of small-animal vertebrae yielded highly reproducible measurements of fatigue life and was suc- cessful, in part, by  ectively controlling for the nominal level of strain applied to these tiny bone specimens. Failure of bone in both static and fatigue loading is largely thought to be strain-controlled (Nalla et al., 2003; Bowman et al., 1998; Keaveny et al., 2001; Keaveny et al., 1994c; Schileo et al., 2008). To apply  repeatable initial strain to each spe- cimen,  consistent measurement of sti ness must  rst be obtained. Our new method utilized specimen-speci  micro-CT-based  nite element analyses to measure specimen sti ness and prescribe an individualized cyclic force for each specimen. In turn, these individualized forces re- sulted in  consistent starting level of strain applied to all test speci- mens, and resulted in similar values of fatigue life. By contrast, our implementations of the two literature methods were unable to con- sistently apply the speci ed starting strain value, which produced more scatter in the magnitude of the applied forces and an unintended -- like relationship. The reduced level of scatter in fatigue life using this method would be particularly helpful for studies limited to  small sample size, such as in vivo animal experiments, to improve detection in cyclic properties. The consistency of our strain-to-failure results with those from other studies supports the validity of our new approach. While the fatigue life will depend on the level of loading, strain-to-failure is emerging as  more uniform outcome across many di erent cyclic loading experi- ments. Our strain-to-failure (mean   SD) value of .20   .80%, from cyclic compression testing of mouse vertebrae, is consistent with Fig. . : Specimen-speci  cyclic loading force and number of cycles to failure, or fatigue life for each method.

Bone Reports  (2018) 165 172\n\ncyclic compression results for other species: .36   .13% for human trabecular bone (Haddock et al., 2004), .85%   .66% for bovine trabecular bone (Bowman et al., 1998), and .19   .52% for rat whole-bone vertebra (Brouwers et al., 2009). similar value in cyclic compressive strain-to-failure between these studies and ours might be expected for two reasons. First, the bone material, primarily the col- lagen component which dominates the plasticity and therefore strain- to-failure of the bone (Burstein et al., 1975), is similar amongst the species listed. And second, others have reported on relatively uniform values for the strain-to-failure independent of apparent density, applied loads, or temperature (Bowman et al., 1998; Keaveny et al., 2001; Keaveny et al., 1994c). While the absolute value of strain to failure will be in uenced by any machine compliance, the general level of agree- ment and small degree of scatter suggests that bone tissue does indeed fail at  narrow range of strain under cyclic loading, and that our protocol was successful in reducing the variation in strain across dif- ferent specimens. Our  ndings also indicate that implementing  pivotable loading platen to ensure uniform contact is important for accuracy of results, at least for these small-animal bones. We observed  reduced Kelastic and fatigue life for the KEXP method compared to the new method, even though the specimens used in both protocols had similar size and mi- croarchitecture (Appendix ; Table ). We attribute these inconsistent results to the rigid platen design used in the KEXP method testing. Even with rigorous specimen preparation in place, we found that perfectly plano-parallel loading surfaces on small bones cannot always be achieved. And without an adjustable platen, the load can be localized to an area that comes into contact with the platen  rst, producing an ef- fective stress concentration. This localized load can result in reduced sti ness and the stress concentration in reduced fatigue life. There are some limitations to this study. First, the bone tissue used in this study was shared tissue, which did not allow for random as- signment of animals across all groups, and thus it is possible specimens di ered across groups. However, the similarity in size and structure of specimen across all groups as per micro-CT analysis (Appendix ; Table ) suggests the only source of appreciable heterogeneity could be in tissue material properties, which is unlikely because the animals were of the same strain, sex, and approximate age. Second, the initial strain values of ( max = .%) used for our new method may be speci  to this particular protocol, which assumed an  ective tissue modulus of 10 GPa in the  nite element analyses. The assumed value was chosen empirically by trial and error on some preliminary test specimens, such that the resulting Fmax values were approximately half of the directly measured ultimate force. To use this method in other animal models, large or small (.. rat, bovine, monkey), similar preliminary testing to determine the value of  max is suggested, particularly if it is suspected that the  ective tissue modulus might di er from mouse vertebrae. We recommend using an elastic strain level that is associated with about half of the ultimate strength. Third, the values of the  ective tissue elastic modulus reported here are speci  to this experiment. Para- meters such as temperature, loading frequency, and use of di erent platens, can all contribute to machine compliance and variation be- tween tests, thus the  ective tissue modulus should not be considered  true material property. Placing an extensometer across the platens directly beside the specimen ends can minimize machine compliance  ects. However, it is best to use the  ective tissue modulus as  relative measurement to compare between untreated and treated spe- cimens within an experiment, but not across studies (.. between mouse and rat bones). Lastly, as with any laboratory-based biomecha- nical testing, the loading con guration does not mimic exact in vivo conditions. Our removal of the endplate and loading via  rigid platen versus loading via intact disc and endplate is  clear limitation. Thus, while our results do not describe expected in vivo behavior, our pro- tocol does produce highly repeatable results, which should help eluci- date changes in bone quality characteristics by aging, disease, or treatment. The main application of our new method is to provide greater sta- tistical power in using small-animal experiments to mechanically assess relevant aspects of bone quality associated with aging, disease, or treatment. small sample size and scatter associated with the fatigue testing present challenges for detecting statistically signi cant  ects unless those  ects are large. For example, Brouwers et al. (Brouwers et al., 2009) found  37.% di erence in steady-state creep rate and 15.% di erence in loss of sti ness with zoledronate treatment in an osteoporotic rat model, but could not report  detectable signi cance due to high variation in the data and loss of some samples. Our KEXP method was similar to their method, which produced standard devia- tions in fatigue life (reported as  time-to-failure ) up to the same magnitude as the mean value. Our new method should reduce that range up to -fold. Furthermore, unlike in the Brouwers literature protocol, we had no loss of specimens, enabled by repeatable specimen preparation (.. 3D-printed support jigs for machining plano-parallel surfaces) and uniform loading of specimen surfaces (.. spherically- seated platen), which further improves statistical power, and can be implemented for monotonic testing or fatigue testing of small-animal vertebrae. That said, our new method is  time intensive process for specimen preparation, micro-CT, image processing, and  nite element analysis. However, the extra  ort improves the ability to detect small di erences across treatment groups without using  large number of animals, which is advantageous both ethically and also logistically when sample sizes are inherently limited (.. space  ight experi- ments). Thus, use of our new method may improve the ability of future studies to elucidate mechanically relevant aspects of bone quality as- sociated with aging, disease, or treatment.

Image processing Image processing of the original micro-CT images was conducted prior to  nite element analysis for each specimen. First, the image stack was reoriented to align the specimen with the -axis (DataViewer v1..., Bruker). Second, the reoriented images were thresholded using the  Default  Autothreshold algorithm in ImageJ (ImageJ .51h, Java ..0_24). The  nal stack was used to build the  nite element model. .. Finite element analysis To determine the computational sti ness, high-resolution linear  nite element analysis was performed. Each 10-  cubic voxel in the images was .. Pendleton et al.

All bone elements were assigned the same elastic, homogeneous and isotropic material properties: elastic modulus 10 GPa and Poisson' ratio of .. These values are based on experimental testing of core samples of trabecular bone from human vertebrae (Bevill and Keaveny, 2009). varied modulus based on tissue mineral density and thus micro-CT greyscale was not used in this methodology due to underestimation of apparent modulus using this approach (Kaynia et al., 2015). Each model was uniaxially compressed to % apparent strain, the input was displacement which varied depending on specimen height. Typical models contained approximately . million elements and were solved using  highly scalable, implicit parallel  nite-element framework Olympus (Adams et al., 2004) running on  Dell Linux Cluster supercomputer (Stampede, Texas Advanced Computing Center). The outcome was the whole- bone reaction force, which was then used to calculate computational sti ness, KFEA (Eq. ), by dividing by the input displacement. =  Reaction force Input displacement FEA () Appendix  Table  The KEXP and KFEA method specimen structural parameters indicate there were no signi cant di erences in specimen size and shape. There were also no signi cant di erences in the mean or standard deviations (-ratio = .65;  = .20) of computed cyclic force between these two groups. The computed cyclic loading force for KEXP group was retrospectively found to demonstrate the di erence in standard deviation of cyclic loading force computed with the KEXP method compared to KFEA method (-ratio = 10.;  < .01). The structural parameters from specimens of the FMAX method are not compared to KEXP and FMAX method groups because of  di erence in resolution of these micro-CT scans (20. ). However, the sti ness and fatigue life measurements are the same for the FMAX and KFEA methods, which suggest the structural parameters for the FMAX method specimens were similar to those used in the KEXP and KFEA methods.

Additionally, there is growing evidence that suggests that not only is the immune system being altered, but the pathogens that infect the host are signi cantly in uenced by space ight and ground-based space ight conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that Serratia marcescens (strain Db11) was signi cantly more lethal to Drosophila melanogaster after growth on the International Space Station than ground-based controls, but the increased virulence phenotype of . marcescens did not persist after the bacterial cultures were passaged on the ground. Increased virulence was also observed in bacteria that were grown in simulated microgravity conditions on the ground using the rotating wall vessel. Increased virulence of the space- own bacteria was similar in magnitude between wild-type  ies and those that were mutants for the well-characterized immune pathways Imd and Toll, suggesting that changes to the host immune system after infection are likely not  major factor contributing towards increased susceptibility of ground-reared  ies infected with space- own bacteria. Characterization of the bacteria shows that at later timepoints space ight bacteria grew at  greater rate than ground controls in vitro, and in the host. These results suggest complex physiological changes occurring in pathogenic bacteria in space environments, and there may be novel mechanisms mediating these physiological effects that need to be characterized. npj Microgravity (2020) : ;  INTRODUCTION As space exploration extends beyond low Earth orbit, there is considerable interest in understanding the changes in human physiology under space ight conditions. Space ight includes not only long-term exposure to microgravity, but also radiation, isolation, and short-term exposure to hypergravity. Previous studies have demonstrated that these stressors have  signi cant impact on the ability of the immune system to respond appropriately to disease, including altered cytokine production,  changes in immune cell proliferation and distribution4,, and general alteration of immune homeostasis in both innate and adaptive immune systems., This apparent immune dysregulation is even more important when considering that there have been studies demonstrating signi cant effects of microgravity and space ight conditions on the pathogens that co-occur with humans in space habitats.10 17 Opportunistic pathogenic bacteria, such as those that can cause persistent infections in immunocompromised individuals, have been shown to have increased growth in space ight,18,19 increased antibiotic resistance, and increased virulence.20,21 Investigations of the effects of space ight in humans have been especially varied, likely due to both low sample sizes and variability in experimental methodology.22 The fruit   (Drosophila melanogaster) is  promising model for understanding the effects of space ight on human immunity and pathogenesis, as they have been shown previously to experience  dramatic shift in immune gene expression following space ight.23,24 Using invertebrate models for investigating the human immune system has proven both fruitful and convenient, as they are cost-effective, have short generation times, and importantly, have immune systems with high homology to humans.25,26 While invertebrates lack  characterized adaptive immune system, the inducible innate immune response of Drosophila melanogaster is highly similar to humans,25,27,28 with about 75% of human disease-causing genes with  functional homolog in the fruit  .25,29 The human opportunistic bacteria Serratia marcescens has only recently emerged as  model for studying rapid shifts in virulence and antibiotic resistance due to increased nosocomial reports.30,31 Furthermore, . marcescens has been found aboard the spacecraft Mir, and in condensed water aboard the International Space Station (ISS),32,33 suggesting that this ubiquitous pathogen should be monitored closely for space ight-induced changes that may pose  threat to immunocompromised astronauts who could be more susceptible to opportunistic pathogens. . melanogaster has been recently used as  model for studying . marcescens, as there are bacterial strains that have been isolated from wild-caught  ies that are pathogenic.34 38 Importantly, the speci  strains used in this study are not pathogenic to humans,34 making this system an ideal model for safely studying space ight-induced changes to . marcescens using  model system. Studies in true space ight conditions are dif cult to perform due to cost, limited availability of launches and crew time, and the complexity of experimental design under the tight volumetric and 1NASA Postdoctoral Program, Universities Space Research Association, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA. 2FILMSS/Bionetics, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA. 3Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California, Berkeley, CA, USA. 4NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, USA. *email:  www.nature.com/npjmgrav Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA 1234567890():,;\n\nmass constraints of space habitats. Consequently, many studies on the effects of space ight on bacteria are also followed up with ground-based simulated microgravity experiments,16,17,39 which allows for further investigation into microgravity-related effects. In this study, the opportunistic pathogen Serratia marcescens was sent to the ISS, where it was exposed to true space ight conditions, while ground-based strains were used in tandem both as controls and as replicates grown in simulated microgravity conditions (rotating wall vessel (RWV) apparatus) in order to investigate whether changes in bacterial physiology could be replicated accurately in future ground-based studies. In our study, space- own or simulated microgravity-treated bacteria were used to infect . melanogaster to investigate changes in space-induced lethality, both in wild-type  ies, as well as in immune pathway mutants. Results showed that both space- own and ground-based microgravity simulations (.., low-shear modeled microgravity or LSMMG treatment) resulted in increased virulence of Serratia marcescens on . melanogaster hosts. Interestingly, the increased virulence phenotype is lost after passaging of the space- own and LSMMG-treated bacteria under ground conditions. Taken together, this suggests that space ight induces  physiological change in the pathogen resulting in the decreased survivability of the . melanogaster host and that this effect can be reversed after the bacterial cells resume normal growth on the ground. RESULTS Survival of . melanogaster after infection with space ight samples Fly survival was signi cantly lower when infected with space ight- exposed Serratia marcescens samples compared to the ground control bacterial samples (Fig. ). For the  rst space ight sample (Space ), survival was signi cantly different from both Ground  ( < .0001) and Ground  ( < .0001) samples. The same was true for the second space ight isolate (Space ) when compared with ground control samples. Full statistical results are reported in Table . Space  and Space  were separate samples of bacteria collected from two different plates after space ight, and both showed increased virulence compared to ground control bacteria. However they also showed differences between each other in terms of the magnitude of their changes with Space  causing greater virulence changes compared to Space  samples. This is discussed later in the context of temporary/reversible physiologi- cal changes induced by space ight vs genetic/heritable changes in the bacteria (see below for  Host survival after injection of  rst ground subculture of space ight sample ). In vivo growth of space ight . marcescens in   host after injection In vivo growth of injected bacteria was not signi cantly different between space and ground samples at hours  ( = .9113,  = .489),  ( = .5316,  = .6772) or  ( = .169,  = .3964) post-injection. At hour 12 post-injection, in vivo growth of Space  sample was signi cantly higher in the   host than the Ground sample ( = .0002) and Space  ( = .0011). At hour 15 post- injection, in vivo growth of Space  remained signi cantly higher than Ground ( = .0002) and Space  ( = .04), and Space  in vivo growth was signi cantly higher than Ground ( = .006) (Fig. 1b). Therefore, the kinetics of bacterial growth within the host are different for the bacterial cultures returning from space compared to the ground control samples, particularly 12  and onwards post-infection. In vitro growth of the space- own bacteria, outside the host, show  similar increase in growth kinetics at later time points compared to the ground control bacteria (Supplementary Fig. ). Host survival after injection of  rst ground subculture of space ight sample Given that two separate isolates of bacteria had shown increased virulence after space ight exposure (Fig. ), we wanted to assess whether these changes were reversible physiological changes in the bacteria induced by the stress of space ight or whether they were genetically heritable changes induced, for instance, by ionizing radiation exposure during space ight. After subculturing space ight and ground samples of . marcescens in normal Earth gravity overnight, Space -injected host survival was not signi cantly different from either Ground  ( = .995) or Ground  ( = .337) host injected samples. Similarly, Space  subculture- infected hosts did not show signi cant differences in survival from Fig. Space ight-exposed Serratia marcescens show increased virulence in  ies.

Full statistical output is reported in Table . These results suggest that the increased virulence detected after space ight were temporary changes acquired by the bacteria during space-  ight and that after subculturing under normal conditions on Earth, these differences were no longer detectable after infection of fruit   hosts. In vivo growth after injection of  rst ground subculture of space ight sample There was no signi cant difference of in vivo growth of the space ight vs ground bacteria within the host (Fig. 2b) at hours  ( = 13.41,  = .146),  ( = .238,  = .866), 12 ( = .443,  = .731) or 15 ( = .479,  = .708) hours post-infection. This data was consistent with the fact that there were no differences detected in virulence of the  rst ground subcultures in the host (Fig. 2a). Host survival after injection with LSMMG-treated bacteria Since space ight opportunities are relatively infrequent,  model that has often been used on the ground to simulate microgravity conditions for aqueous cultures is the high aspect ratio vessel (HARV) or the RWV.15,17,39 We used the RWV apparatus to assess whether we could recreate some or all of the virulence changes that we had measured from the space ight samples by simulating the low  uid shear of the microgravity environment on Earth. This is done by rotating the vessel in  perpendicular orientation, where the rotation of the apparatus offsets the sedimental effects of the gravity force and provides continual suspension of the cells. In the control, the axis of rotation is parallel with the gravity force vector and as such, this force is not offset and the cells are allowed to settle.11,13 Host survival was signi cantly lower for hosts infected with . marcescens that was grown in LSMMG compared to both the PBS Sham (ratio = .42,  < .0001) and the RWV Control (Ratio = .37,  = .0002) (Fig. 3a).",

The RWV Control consists of the same container as is used to simulate microgravity but is rotated about an axis that is oriented at 90 degrees to the LSMMG rotation and is therefore exposed to   Earth  gravity.11 Figure 3a therefore shows that we are able to recreate increased virulence in . marcescens bacteria by simulating microgravity on Earth. This would suggest that the microgravity aspect of the space ight environment is at least one important factor to consider in terms of increased virulence in . marcescens.

However, there was  signi cant difference in CFU counts per   between the LSMMG and RWV-Control at hours  ( = 20.428,  = .008), 12 ( = 12.455,  = .019), and 15 ( = 18.427,  = .009) post- infection (Fig. 3b). These altered growth kinetics also mirror some of the differences observed previously with the space ight samples (Fig. 1b), where the bacterial samples that show increased virulence, also show increased rates of growth within the host particularly at later time points. Infection of Immune De ciency (Imd) and Toll pathway mutants of . melanogaster Since the increase in virulence of space ight bacteria was accompanied by an increase in the rate of growth of the bacteria within the   host, we wanted to determine whether this was  result of  change that the bacteria were able to induce in the host by weakening the hosts  immune system for example, or whether the bacterial physiology was altered to better withstand the host  immune defenses. In order to test this hypothesis, we used  ies that were mutant in two of the major immune defense pathways in  ies, the Imd and the Toll pathways.40,41 As expected, all Imd mutant  ies (PGRP-LC , imd1, and relishE20) succumb to any Sm infections (including ground control Sm) much more quickly than either of the wild-type   lines (y1w* or w1118) as seen in Fig. 4a, since the Imd pathway is known to be critical for defense against infection with Gram-negative bacteria,42 such as Serratia marces- cens. On the other hand, the Toll pathway is primarily known to be important for defense against Gram-positive bacterial and fungal infections. Therefore as expected, there is much less change in the viability of Toll de cient mutants (PGRP-SAseml and dif1) after ground control Sm infections compared to wild-type  ies (Fig. 4c). Compared to ground control Sm however, the space ight bacteria Space  causes greater lethality in all of the   lines (compare Fig. 4b vs , and 4d vs ). Therefore the data suggests that regardless of the genotype of the   host, whether impaired for immune function or robust wild-type lines, the space- own bacteria causes greater lethality than ground control Sm. The statistical output is shown in Supplementary Tables  . RNA sequencing data analysis of infected ground-reared host To further test whether infection with microgravity-treated bacteria induced changes in gene expression in the ground- reared host, RNA sequencing was performed for wild-type fruit  ies after infection with either space ight or ground control sample of . marcescens. These results showed that there were few signi cant changes in host gene expression of known immune- related genes when exposed to the two bacterial sample types (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Table ). At the signi cance threshold (-values < .05), only eleven transcripts were signi cantly differentially expressed. However principal components analysis (PCA) comparing transcript abun- dance across the treatments showed that there is signi cant overlap among the groups, further indicating that there are few differences between the space bacteria-infected and ground bacteria-infected fruit   hosts (Fig. 4f). It is worth noting that, since the  ies collected for RNA-Seq were still alive at 18  post- injection, this may have biased the selection of  ies in which infection had not greatly progressed, as they were still alive at this late time point. Similarity in gene expression across both conditions to  control sham condition shown by PCA supports this idea. Comparing the space bacteria-infected ground  ies to the ground bacteria-infected  ies, there were  total of 11 differentially expressed genes (see Fig. 4e and Supplementary Table  for gene details). Out of these 11 differentially expressed genes, only AttA (Attacin-) is known to be directly related to the immune response.43 The gene AttA is an antimicrobial peptide that is expressed in the fat body in response to Gram-negative pathogens.43 The most highly overexpressed gene is lola (long- itudinals lacking),  gene that is involved in axon growth and guidance in the central and peripheral nervous systems.44 The next most highly overexpressed gene is vsg (visgun),  gene linked to alcohol sensitivity.45 Among the most underexpressed genes is eEF2, is  translation elongation factor,46 and CG31650 with unknown function. The underexpressed RhoGEF2 has been recently linked to wound repair, but is primarily involved in the regulation of actin and myosin dynamics through interacting effector proteins.47 While only one of these genes is directly related to the host immune pathway, follow-up studies will be conducted to elucidate the potential role of these additional differentially expressed genes in the host. DISCUSSION In this study, we found that  ies infected with  bacterial pathogen that had been grown during space ight was signi - cantly more lethal than ground controls (Fig. ). This trend persisted in strains that had been grown in LSMMG conditions, suggesting that microgravity may be the primary factor mediating the differences in virulence seen in the space ight bacteria strains (Fig. ). Interestingly, this increased lethality disappears after the  rst subculture is conducted on the ground, which means that the differences in virulence are short-lived and do not persist after being cultured under normal gravity conditions (Fig. ). This is consistent with previous studies, which found that space ight- induced changes to pathogens, such as Bacillus subtilis; Escherichia coli; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Staphylococcus aureus reverted upon return to Earth conditions.10 We also sought to understand whether the host immune system may be responding differently to space ight-altered bacteria. While it has been shown in previous studies that space- own pathogens decrease the survival of hosts compared to their ground-reared counterparts,15,16 less is known about how the host immune system may be in uenced differently by space-  own pathogens. This is also the  rst study in space ight and in simulated microgravity to evaluate microgravity-induced changes of the pathogen . marcescens in  live host, as previous studies in the  eld of host-pathogen interactions have focused primarily on Salmonella15 and other microbes.48 50 Utilizing common immune pathway mutants, we determined that regardless of whether the Imd or Toll pathways were altered, infection with space ight sample decreases survival of  ies compared to infection with ground sample of . marcescens (Fig. ). Studies in space ight and modeled microgravity have shown that when the host is exposed to microgravity conditions, the immune responses can be altered by the presence of symbiotic bacteria.51 Other studies have shown that when different pathogens are exposed to LSMMG and then tested on naive hosts, responses can vary widely depending on the speci  pathogen used.52 Similarly in our study with ground- reared   host, while there appear to be few genes that are differentially expressed after injection with space ight-exposed Serratia marcescens compared to the ground control bacteria, most of the highly differentially regulated genes do not appear to be directly immune-related, with the exception of Attacin (Fig. 4c, Supplementary Table ). This antimicrobial peptide is known to respond to Gram-negative pathogens,43 so an increase in expression in response to . marcescens is expected. However, the increase in expression in space-infected  ies compared to ground-infected  ies may be due to the increase in bacterial load in the space-infected individuals. . Gilbert et al. npj Microgravity (2020)  Published in cooperation with the Biodesign Institute at Arizona State University, with the support of NASA\n\nBecause there is  signi cant increase of in vivo growth seen in both space ight samples and LSMMG samples, it may be possible that some of these host genes may have an unknown interaction with the immune system that facilitates the faster proliferation of microgravity-experienced bacteria after infection. However given that the space- own bacteria have faster growth kinetics in vitro (Supplementary Fig. ) as well as in vivo, the current results indicate that the differences in lethality and survival following infection of bacteria altered by space ight and LSMMG are likely due to changes to the pathogen, rather than  difference in host immune response of ground-reared  ies. This study is the  rst to demonstrate that space ight in uences the growth and virulence characteristics of bacteria grown on  solid substrate. While many previous studies have shown that cell density and growth characteristics are altered in liquid suspension during space ight (reviewed in Huang et al.,53) the few studies that have cultured microbes on solid media found no difference in  nal cell density.54 Therefore, it was concluded that because there is no change in gravity vector for bacteria that are attached to  surface compared to those in  liquid suspension where there would be  lack of convection, that one should not expect to see  change in phenotype associated with growth on solid media in space ight.",

Because it  thought that LSMMG may in uence cell polarity in some single-celled organ- isms, it  at least theoretically possible that some of these species may still be affected by microgravity at the cellular level, even on  solid substrate.59  previous study showed that growth of .coli and .subtilis on agar in space ight did not show increased growth rates, and they did not measure virulence phenotypes of the samples.54 Therefore, it is possible that changes in phenotype in space can be manifested differently in different bacteria depend- ing on the inherent characteristics required to colonize their normal habitat. While Wang et al.60 showed that . marcescens did not change in physical properties on  semi-solid media in space ight conditions, they did provide evidence that signi cant transcrip- tomic and proteomic changes related to metabolism occurred in space ight sample compared to ground. We believe that these molecular and biological changes observed in . marcescens on  semi-solid media in space ight provide  basis for the phenotypic changes observed in our study with bacteria grown on solid semi- de ned media. While there was insuf cient bacterial sample to conduct transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in the current study,  subsequent space ight experiment in our lab has been conducted with . marcescens to further characterize molecular changes on both solid and liquid media types in space and will be reported separately. This indicates that media type should not be limited to liquid suspension, and that further studies using both solid and liquid media types is warranted. study performed with  different strain of . marcescens (ATCC 14041) in LSMMG in liquid media showed that while there was no signi cant change in growth parameters, there was an increase in acid stress resistance, providing further evidence for phenotypic changes of this species to microgravity and LSMMG.61 Ongoing work in our lab, including more in-depth characterization of . marcescens under LSMMG and space ight conditions, are currently being conducted to further elucidate the potential molecular and physiological mechanisms affecting growth kinetics and changes in virulence seen in altered gravity. previous study found that growth rate was not  major factor affecting the physiology and virulence of one strain . marces- cens,62 but there is speculation that growth rate and virulence may be linked due to common factors that in uence both character- istics.63,64 Recent studies in humans demonstrated that slower growth rates of Bacillus pathogens actually predicted higher virulence,65 suggesting that there is con icting data that likely varies by species and environmental factors and that growth rates may be linked to virulence. In the current study, not only was the in vitro growth at later time points signi cantly higher in the space ight strains than in the ground control strains (Supple- mentary Fig. ), and there is  signi cant difference with in vivo growth after infection with space ight and ground control strains (Fig. 1b), as well as increased in vivo growth in LSMMG bacteria compared to the RWV-control (Fig. 3b). This suggests that bacteria growth rates are perhaps linked to the increased lethality between space ight strains and ground strains, especially since we did not  nd signi cant changes in host immune-related genes after infection with space ight sample compared to ground sample in wild-type ground-reared  ies (Fig. 4a  and Supplementary Table ). Furthermore, in vitro growth was signi cantly higher for space ight samples compared to ground samples, speci cally starting around hour 12, which is consistent with the in vivo increase in growth after injections (Supplementary Fig. ). Previous studies have shown that the media composition and nutrient availability can have signi cant effects on growth kinetics and virulence of pathogens.16 Current studies in our laboratory are testing whether microgravity treatment confers  speci  growth advantage over ground bacteria at later times in growth when speci  nutrients may become limiting in the media, as well as whether or not growth kinetics can be affected by the inclusion or exclusion of speci  growth factors from the media. Speci cally, it may be possible that the space ight and LSMMG environment may confer some advantage to the bacteria when nutrients become limited, such that the low  uid shear environment allows growth to either increase or not become hindered by the decrease in nutrient in the media over time. This also emphasizes the need to understand the underlying molecular mechanisms of pathogens that are changing in LSMMG and space ight conditions, which has become   eld of great interest recently. It has been shown that after space ight, there are global changes in expression of genes that may potentially be related to virulence15,17 and that some pathogens are more likely to form bio lms after exposure to space ight.18 Because the pathogens in the current study are also Gram-negative and are similarly opportunistic to the pathogens evaluated in previous studies, it may be expected that there are quanti able genetic mechanisms that may be responsible for the decreased survival we found after infection. Therefore, current studies are focused on eliciting the potential underlying genetic mechanisms that are driving increased virulence. MATERIALS AND METHODS . melanogaster   strains Fly lines were maintained in  12- light-dark cycle on cornmeal-agar media (torula yeast, dextrose, cornmeal, agar, Tegosept, propionic acid, ethanol) at ambient temperature (~24  ). All   lines were obtained from Bloomington Stock center including w1118 (#3605), OregonR SP2 (no. 2376), relE20 (no. 55714), y1w* (no. 55707), dif1 (no. 36559), imd1 (no. 55711), PGRP-LC  (#36323), and PGRP-SAseml (#55716). Bacterial growth conditions during space ight The hardware used in this study was the FIT (Fly Immunity and Tumors) cassette and changeout platform, as described in our previous Drosophila experiments on the ISS.23,66 Food trays were prepared using the methods described below, and stored in  cargo transfer bag (CTB) at    for launch. Towards the end of the 30 day space ight (Fruit Fly Lab   01 on SpaceX-CRS  mission), the food trays containing . marcescens were retrieved from    storage and placed within the FIT food changeout platform. The platform was placed in  canvas CTB at ISS ambient temperature (23 25  ) for  days, plus  days in the SpaceX Dragon (22 25  ) for undocking/descent and retrieval. During the growth period, environmental data (CO2, O2, temperature, and relative humidity) was recorded and used to match the growth conditions for ground control experiments. Preparation of . marcescens Db11 for space ight Serratia marcescens Db11 was obtained from the University of Minnesota . elegans stock center. To prepare for the space ight experiment, the Db11 strain was grown for 20  in liquid LB broth with 100  /mL streptomycin at 37   and then diluted to an OD600 of .100 in PBS. Next, 100   of the diluent was spread onto the surface of two trays containing  mL of solid semi-de ned   food media containing % Brewer  yeast (Redstar), % glucose, % sucrose, % yeast extract, % peptone, % agar, .05% magnesium sulfate heptahydrate, .05% calcium chloride dihydrate (Sigma), .% of blue food dye (Smart and Final), .001% -hydro- xybenzoate, and .% of propionic acid (Sigma) dissolved in water. These two trays were the source of the Space  and Space  samples that were used in the experiments below. Similarly, we prepared two additional trays (Ground  and Ground ) from the same source sample. These two trays were grown in the same FIT hardware on the ground, inside an incubator (Percival model DR36VL), which was programmed to match the gas composition, temperature, and humidity pro les measured during the  ight. .

Control trays were stored on the ground at   . Growth conditions on the ISS were described in the previous section. Upon retrieval after the space ight mission, bacteria were isolated from the surfaces using sterile cell scrapers and then placed into 50% glycerol and stored frozen at  80  . Similar isolation was performed in parallel for the ground samples. The placement of the bacterial cultures on semi-de ned   food media allowed for in ight infection of  ies, as  ies would ingest the bacteria that was growing on the media. However, due to logistical constraints during  ight, in- ight infection was not possible and the bacterial cultures were grown in space and harvested after return for treatment of  ies on the ground after  ight as described in the following sections. Injection of space ight . marcescens Db11 samples into . melanogaster Injections of bacteria were performed according to methods described previously by our group and others.23,67 Concentrations of space ight and ground samples stored in 50% glycerol at  80   were determined by performing colony counts on LB plates. These samples were then diluted in PBS (phosphate buffered saline) down to ~   103 CFU/mL in sterile PBS for injections. Sterile 12.% glycerol in sterile PBS was used as  sham injection control. For survival experiments and in vivo growth assays for both space ight bacteria and ground-based simulated microgravity-treated bacteria, the Nanoject II (Drummond Scienti ) was used with the 32 nL injection volume setting (Figs  ). Concentrations were adjusted so that each injection was ~10 CFU/ .",

For survival experiments and in vivo growth assays for both space ight bacteria and ground-based simulated microgravity-treated bacteria, the Nanoject II (Drummond Scienti ) was used with the 32 nL injection volume setting (Figs  ). Concentrations were adjusted so that each injection was ~10 CFU/ . Control, ground, or space ight samples were then injected into anesthetized   day-old female (post-eclosion) . melanogaster in the ventrolateral abdomen. Injections of immune mutant  ies were done using  Picospritzer III (Parker Hanni , New Hampshire). Injection bolus was calibrated to 600 nm diameter, which equaled approximately 10 CFU/ . Injections of each treatment group took < , with the survival measurements beginning at the end of that  rst hour. After injections,  ies were kept at 25   on the same standard dextrose food that they were reared on, and survival was monitored every hour for at least 24 . Survival curves were measured by performing three independent experiments using  minimum of  = 50  ies in each experiment, then pooling the data from all three experiments for the Cox Proportional Hazard survival analysis, which measures the magnitude of difference in survival between different treatment groups. In vivo bacterial load was assayed in the   at , , 12, and 15  post- injection. Bacterial load was assayed immediately following injection by placing three  ies in 200   of PBS and homogenized for ~ min using  handheld homogenizer (Kimble/Kontes, New Jersey). This homogenization procedure was repeated for each condition tested. Next, 100   of this sample was then spread/plated onto an LB agar plate. To assay subsequent time-points, three  ies were placed in 200   of PBS and homogenized as above. This sample was then serially diluted, 20   into 180   of PBS until  dilution of 105 was obtained. Next, 40   from each dilution from 100 to 105 was then spot plated onto an LB agar plate and allowed to dry. All plates were incubated at 37   overnight before counting. Each in vivo bacterial load experiment was independently repeated three times and each experiment included three replicate samples per time point for all experiments. Error bars were calculated to represent one standard error. Due to limited bacterial sample availability from the space ight mission and the time required to inject 50 or more individual  ies per condition per experiment, not all samples (Space  and , Ground  and ) were included in every experiment. After initial experiments had veri ed the consistency of the virulence data from Space  and Space  samples relative to the Ground  and Ground  samples, only one sample from each space ight and ground condition was chosen in subsequent studies. Ground subcultures of space ight sample Injections to test the virulence of space- own bacteria were performed as noted above where the space ight and ground bacteria were diluted in PBS from frozen glycerol stocks and directly injected into the   host. However to test whether the space- own bacteria would retain their increased virulence after growing under ground conditions for several generations, bacterial cultures were  rst allowed to grow for 24  (~23 generations of growth) on the ground before injecting into Drosophila hosts. sterile inoculation loop was used to transfer  small amount of glycerol stocks into liquid LB + 100  /mL streptomycin, then grown for 24  in  37   incubator with  shaker set to 225 rpm. These samples were then diluted in PBS down to ~   103 CFU/mL in sterile PBS for injections, and injections were performed as described above. Growth of . marcescens Db11 in the RWV Cultures of Db11 were grown from non-space ight lab stocks of Db11 frozen at  80   in Copan Cryovials, onto agar plates with streptomycin (LB + 100  /mL) for 18 24  and then stored at    for at most  weeks. Liquid subcultures were created using  single colony from these agar plates and grown in conical tubes at 37   in liquid LB media containing 100  /mL streptomycin at 25 rpm for 24 . These liquid subcultures were then diluted down to A600 of .100 in LB media before being further diluted :1000 in LB + 100  /mL streptomycin and placed into  sterile disposable 10 mL RWV (Synthecon). Air bubbles were removed from the RWV and sealed. Pairs of RWV were then placed in either horizontal (simulated microgravity or LSMMG) or vertical (normal gravity, NG) axis at 37   and rotated at 25 rpm (as in Nickerson et al.11) Samples were grown for 24  to ensure that stationary phase was reached. Injection of RWV samples into . melanogaster Injections were performed as noted above with the following alterations. Stationary phase cultures from RWV were diluted down to an A600 of .100 in PBS and then further diluted down /100 fold to an end concentration of ~   103 CFU/mL in PBS. Approximately 65 nL of sterile PBS, LSMMG, or NG cultures were then injected into  -day old  ies as noted above. Survival and bacterial load were both monitored as previously stated. RNA extraction and sequencing from infected   host In order to see whether there was any difference in host immunity after infection with Space or Ground bacteria, RNA was extracted in triplicate from two live ground-reared adult  ies for each treatment (space or ground sample injection) approximately 18  after infection using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (catalog no. 74104) with  -mercaptoethanol (10  /mL) in the lysis buffer. Lysis was performed by placing the  ies in  . mL tube containing 600   of the lysis buffer, which were then homogenized for ~ min using  handheld homogenizer (Kimble/Kontes, New Jersey). The entire homogenate was then placed in the manufacturer- supplied spin column, where an on-column DNase digestion step was performed as per manufacturer recommendation). An additional puri ca- tion step was added using additional wash steps with the kit buffers. Samples were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform with 100 bp reads and paired-end library prep. Transcript abundance estimates from the raw sequenced reads were made using kallisto (version .42.)68 and the . melanogaster reference transcriptome (build r6.13). Differential expression analysis between Space and Ground bacteria infection conditions was performed using sleuth (version .30.) Wald test.69 Transcripts with -values < .05 were considered signi cantly differentially expressed. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed in GraphPad Prism . and JMP Pro 13 (SAS). Graphs were made in GraphPad Prism . and in Excel (version 15.). For survival analyses,  Cox Proportional Hazards model was used, with the exception of the Toll and Imd mutant injections, for which  Log-rank Mantel-Cox analysis was performed to compare curves across treatments. The Cox Proportional Hazards model allows for the comparison of survival between all groups when there are multiple risk factors or treatments involved. For in vivo growth measurements,  one-way ANOVA was used in combination with  Tukey-Kramer post hoc analysis. For all statistical analyses with the exception of the  rst subculture growth and survival, only results with  statistical signi cance < .05 are reported, due to the magnitude of results tables. Ethics statement We use the invertebrate model system Drosophila melanogaster for this study, in accordance, the study was exempt from ethics committee approval.

The International Space Station (ISS) is ideal for investigating microbial diversity and virulence associated with spaceflight. The shotgun metagenomics data of the ISS generated during the Microbial Tracking  (MT-) project and resulting metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) across three flights in eight different locations during 12 months were used in this study. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with whole genomes of 226 cultivable strains, 21 shotgun metagenome sequences, and 24 MAGs retrieved from the ISS environmental samples that were treated with propidium monoazide (PMA; viable microbes). Results: We have analyzed the data using  deep learning model, allowing us to go beyond traditional cut-offs based only on high DNA sequence similarity and extending the catalog of AMR genes. Our results in PMA treated samples revealed AMR dominance in the last flight for Kalamiella piersonii,  bacteria related to urinary tract infection in humans. The analysis of 226 pure strains isolated from the MT- project revealed hundreds of antibiotic resistance genes from many isolates, including two top-ranking species that corresponded to strains of Enterobacter bugandensis and Bacillus cereus. Computational predictions were experimentally validated by antibiotic resistance profiles in these two species, showing  high degree of concordance. Specifically, disc assay data confirmed the high resistance of these two pathogens to various beta-lactam antibiotics. Conclusion: Overall, our computational predictions and validation analyses demonstrate the advantages of machine learning to uncover concealed AMR determinants in metagenomics datasets, expanding the understanding of the ISS environmental microbiomes and their pathogenic potential in humans.

Microbiome (2022) 10:134 threats to human health, food security, and develop- ment [58]. Accordingly, with NASA setting the course to return to the Moon with the Artemis mission and eventually venture out to Mars, maintaining the health of astronauts during long-term spaceflight is of para- mount importance []. One area of particular concern is the reported increase in virulence and antibiotic resistance of microorganisms in space experiments [, 30, 36, 49, 51, 56, 61]. Combined with  depressed or altered immune response in astronauts [25, 46], there is an increased risk of opportunistic microbial infec- tion. Spaceflight promotes biofilm formation [32], and bacteria cultured from astronauts during flight were more resistant than isolates obtained from the same individual either pre- or post-flight [50]. Mutations also occurred more frequently in long-term spaceflights [24]. An alternative non-mutually exclusive hypothesis to increased virulence or microbial resistance to anti- biotics is that spaceflight conditions might alter the stability of pharmaceuticals [23]. In any case, bacterial infections might be more challenging to treat in space. The International Space Station (ISS) is  closed-built environment with its own environmental microbiome shaped by microgravity, radiation, and limited human presence [53]. We and others have shown that microbi- omes are dynamic, diverse and sometimes intertwined at the ISS. Be et al. [] analyzed antibiotic resistance and virulence genes from dust and vacuum filter samples of ISS (treated with propidium monoazide, or PMA), dem- onstrating that human skin-associated microbes impact the ISS microbiome. Indeed, the skin and intestinal microbiomes of astronauts that spent  to 12 months in the ISS have been shown to be altered [55]. In addition, the salivary microbiome of astronauts changed as  result of spaceflight, potentially activating microbes that pro- mote viral replication [52] and altering the abundance of some antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes [35]. The ISS itself also presents specific core microbiome signatures on its surfaces that we characterized recently using shot- gun metagenome and amplicon sequencing [14, 43, 51], analogous to microbiome signatures found in specific geographies on Earth [18]. Further analyses across several missions have revealed that the microbiome of the crew  skin resembled those of the surfaces inside the ISS collected by the crewmember on the same flight []. To better understand the compo- sition of these bacterial populations we and others have characterized shotgun whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of several ISS microorganisms [10, 11, 45]. Although most of them have been found to be non-pathogenic to humans, there are exceptions such as antibiotic-resist- ant Enterobacter bugandensis strains that could have an increased chance of pathogenicity [44]. Computational analyses of microbiome data collected in Earth have shown that AMR can be predicted from genomic sequence of pure cultures alone [29, 47], but  consensus approach on the best way to detect AMRs in metagenomic datasets has yet to be established [41]. Generally, predictions are restricted to high identity (high sequence similarity to databases) cut-offs, requir- ing   best-hit  on an appropriate AMR database with  sequence identity greater than 80% by many programs such as ResFinder [60]. Although the  best-hit  approach has  low false-positive rate, the false-negative rate can be very high, and  large number of actual Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) are predicted as non-ARGs, thus concealing the identification of potentially func- tional ARGs []. Another method of identification is to link the immune repertoire of the astronaut to the pep- tides of the microbes on the ISS, but this requires com- plex coordination with crew sampling and is rare [19]. However, it has been shown recently that deep learn- ing,  class of machine learning algorithms, can expand the catalog of AMR genes and increase the accuracy of the predictions based on metagenomic data [, 13, 27]. We then hypothesized that the characterization of AMR from sequencing data at the ISS could be investi- gated from an artificial intelligence perspective using  robust deep learning framework. For that, we analyzed whole-genome sequences of 226 pure strains (cultivable microbes), metagenome sequences of 21 environmental samples, and 24 MAGs retrieved from PMA treated sam- ples (Fig. ) using the supervised deep learning approach proposed by Arango-Argoty et al. [], which has shown high sensitivity for detection of AMR genes in an inde- pendent benchmark [57]. Results Predictions based on short metagenomics sequences and ORFs partly overlap with previous analyses and reveal new AMR determinants at the ISS surface microbiome The first shotgun metagenome sequencing of intact microbial cells (Propidium monoazide-PMA treated) without whole-genome amplification was performed by Singh et al. [43]. There, samples were taken in  locations across three flights (F1, F2, F3) during  period of 12 months. detailed description of sampling procedures and locations, species diversity and functional charac- terization can be found in Singh et al. [43]. To deploy  deep learning approach for predicting antibiotic resist- ance genes from metagenomic data, we used DeepARG,  computational resource proven to be more accurate than traditional approaches []. We first run DeepARG- SS (DeepARG for short reads) using the recommended prediction probability cut-off of . to obtain read counts of AMR genes (Fig. 2a). As in the seminal paper\n\nPage  of 12 Madrigal et al. Microbiome (2022) 10:134 [43], quantification of antibiotics associated with AMR revealed  beta lactams  ranking first and  peptide  sec- ond, and generally more AMR reads counts observed in Flight  (F3) than in previous two flights (Fig. 2a). How- ever, reads counts in certain antibiotics such as pleuro- mutilin, mupirocin and rifamycin were found largely in Flight  (Fig. 2a). Our read counts correlate ( = .86,  = .879e ; Pearson  product-moment correlation) with read counts obtained for antimicrobial resistance by Singh et al. [43] (Fig. 2b). Taken together, these suggest  partial overlap with results obtained in Singh et al. [43] analyzed using the traditional approach. While more AMR reads counts were found in Flight , we also observed variability between the different locations and flights, and an increasing number of read counts associated with time. For instance, location  (L4, surface of the dining table) increased the number of AMR reads counts with successive flights (Fig. 2b, ). While resistance to  beta lactams  was evenly distributed across flights and locations, resistance to  polymyxin  and especially  peptide  represents  more significant pro- portion of AMR counts in locations of Flight  (Fig. 2c). In addition, we also observed the widespread presence of reads related to Macrolides, Lincosamides, Strepto- gamines (MLS), and tetracycline resistance. To investigate the possible association between AMR patterns and specific microbes, we assembled the short reads into Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs; see Methods), identified their Open Reading Frames (ORFs), and repeated the prediction of ARGs using DeepARG-LS []. Figure 3a shows the distribution of DeepARG classification probabilities and best-hit iden- tity of ARGs in MAGs from the ISS. As we can retrieve highly probable ARGs (probability > .) presenting low sequence identity (for many ARGs, identity is < 40%), this method is likely more advantageous than using the  best- hit  approach only. Compared to DeepARG-SS results obtained previously, the analysis of MAGs did not reveal significant differences in the number of ARGs predicted in the ORFs for the different flights (Fig. 3b). However, interestingly the results show  smaller number bacterial species having ARGs in Flight # (F1) when compared to Flights # and # (Fig. 3b, ) (data is shown for MAGs with at least  predicted ARG; the total number of MAGs analyzed is 24). Specifically, the number of locations is smaller in Flight  ( = ) than in F2 ( = ) and F3 ( = ) (Fig. 3b). Many ARGs were identified in Kalamiella piersonii MAGs in multiple locations during F3, show- ing AMR patterns related to (glyco)peptide, fluoroqui- nolone and MLS (Fig. 3c). Of note, the . piersonii strain closely related to one found at the ISS has been associ- ated to human urinary tract infection [40]. The poten- tially very pathogenic microbe . bugandensis was found in location  (forward side panel wall of the Waste and Hygiene Compartment) in Flight , presenting more than 40 ARGs. In addition, in the original study, Pantoea spe- cies were found to be the dominant genus in samples in  out of  locations sampled from Flight , especially at Fig. Overview of sample collection and data analysis for the characterization of antibiotic resistance at the ISS using deep learning. The data are processed in  step-wise fashion including data QC, mapping, quantification, and matching to time of collection and mission.

Distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in scaffolds of Microbial Tracking  strains isolated from the ISS We then applied DeepARG-LS to 226 Microbial Track- ing- (MT-) isolates (Mason and Venkateswaran labs, published and unpublished WGS of MT- pure strains isolated from ISS environment). We found  range of  to 92 ARGs in 184 out of 226 isolates (Fig. 4a; Table S1). This machine learning approach allowed us to go beyond the traditional cut-off based only on high sequence DNA simi- larity (Figure S1). These results suggest  widespread pres- ence of potential ARGs in the isolates, with  multi-drug  class being first, followed by glycopeptides, beta-lactams, bacitracin, and tetracyclines. The  multi-drug  antibiotic class was defined by aggregating several antibiotic names from the CARD and ARDB databases (efflux, multi-drug and na_antimicrobials). We then used BLAST to match isolates showing AMR sequences predicted by Deep- ARG to microbial species (Fig. 4a) and identified Bacillus cereus and . bugandensis, which were previously profiled organisms on the ISS [44, 54] as the top  ranking species with  high number of ARGs. We have previously shown that five . bugandensis isolates were almost equivalent to nosocomial earth isolates showing resistance to multi-drug antibiotic compounds, fluoroquinolones, and fosfomycin [44]. In addition, . bugandensis strains were shown to be resistant to  antibiotics [51]. Our results reinforce the potential pathogenicity of this microbe. Nonetheless, anti- microbial resistance was not examined for . cereus strains in Venkateswaran et al. [54]. . cereus is  food poisoning microorganism that might be  concern for crew mem- bers  health. In addition, we found novel ARGs associated with other species such as . pneumoniae, Pantoea, Pae- nibacillus polymyxa, Bacillus velezensis, Enterococcus fae- calis, Sphingomonas, and, with  lower number of ARGs, several species of Staphylococcus. . faecalis virulence was previously shown to be affected by microgravity [28]. We then used the tool Prokka [42] to fully annotate the bacte- rial isolates, finding as expected that the number of coding sequences, but not the number of ARGs, increased in pro- portion to genome sizes (Figure S2a). Then, we ran the pan- genome analysis tool Roary [38] to compare isolates of . bugandensis (10) and . cereus (10) finding that the core set of genes was highly conserved among strains of the same species (Figure S2b). To experimentally validate machine learning predic- tions on previously unobserved AMR patterns above, we performed Antibacterial Susceptibility Tests (AST) for the species found to be potentially most pathogenic, in our case . bugandensis and . cereus as they have  higher number of ARGs (Table S1; Fig. 4a). For that, we use disc diffusion on strains isolated at the ISS for the fol- lowing antimicrobials: Cefazolin (beta lactam), Cefoxitin (beta lactam), Ciprofloxacin (quinolone), Erythromycin (MLS), Gentamycin (aminoglycoside), Oxacillin (beta lac- tam), Penicillin (beta lactam), Rifampin (rifamycin), and Tobramycin (aminoglycoside) (Fig. 4b). The prediction pat- terns closely matched the AST results (Fig. 4b), although DeepARG failed to detect Rifampin resistance, especially for . bugandensis. Although different antibiotics have different inhibitory zone cut-offs for  strain to be considered as resistant (Table S2), remarkably we found an inverse correlation between the zone of inhibition and ARG count for . cereus ( =   .637, Pearson  product-moment correla- tion,  = .2e ) and . bugandensis ( =   .517;  = .0002765) (Fig. 4c), demonstrating the applicability and high accuracy of computational prediction of AMR for microbiome data obtained in space. Discussion Many ARGs that present high probability but low sequence identity to known sequences will be missed using traditional  best-hit  approaches that require  high degree of sequence identity. To solve this, compu- tational methods have been developed to identify AMR in genomes and metagenomes [, , 16, 33, 41]. Despite these developments,  consensus approach to detect AMR in metagenomics datasets is yet to be defined [41]. The objective of this study was to identify the AMR genes associated with cultivated strains and metagenomes generated from the ISS environmental surfaces using an accurate deep learning approach (Fig. ). Firstly, we re-analyzed shotgun metagenome sequences of 21 environmental samples that were treated with PMA (viable microbes), and their associated 24 MAGs retrieved from the PMA-treated samples. The re-analysis showed increased read counts associated with AMR and Fig. Heatmap and clustering of ARG counts detected in MT- pure strains isolated from the ISS and AST validations.

This could be explained due to the ISS crew being replaced during Flight . The abundance of Enterobac- teriaceae in Flight  was discussed in Singh et al. [43]. We have not observed any differences between early vs. late ISS microbiome cultures. For example, Enterobacter bugandansis strains were isolated from F2 and F3 sample sets, but the genome comparison and phenotype analy- ses revealed limited change, with  maximum of 15 SNPs among ISS isolates [44]. In addition, . piersonii spread across four different locations (L1, L5, L7, L8) at Flight , presenting resistance to specific antibiotics (glyco/ peptide, fluoroquinolone and MLS) (Fig. 3c). We have previously isolated strains from Locations , , , , and , defining  novel bacterial genus from the ISS samples [45]. While . piersonii do have virulence genes in the genome,  dichotomy was found as disc diffusion tests revealed multi-drug resistance, while the PathogenFinder algorithm predicted . piersonii strains as non-human pathogens. All seven . piersonii isolates were resistant to cefoxitin (beta_lactam class in DeepARG), erythromycin (MLS), oxacillin (beta_lactam), penicillin (beta_lactam), and rifampin. At the same time, all strains were suscepti- ble to cefazolin, ciprofloxacin (quinolone), and tobramy- cin (aminoglycoside) [45]. The DeepARG database does not include some of these antibiotics, but we found AMR sequences related to resistance to (glyco)peptide, fluoro- quinolone, and MLS, validating some previous results. Therefore, PathogenFinder [17] results in Singh et al. [45] suggesting . piersonii as  non-human pathogen should be treated with caution. Furthermore, the strain YU22 (closest match is IIIF1SW-P2T detected as ISS) isolated in urine microbiome of  kidney stone patient has shown to be an uropathogenic bacteria, showing many virulence factors that are needed for host cell invasion and coloni- zation [40]. Secondly, the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of 226 pure strains (cultivable microbes) were analyzed to iden- tify AMR genes (Fig. 4a). We found the human pathogens . bugandensis and . cereus presenting many potential ARGs in the MT- scaffolds. Up to five strains isolated from the ISS have been closely related to the type strain EB-247T and two clinical isolates (153_ECLO and MBRL 1077) and share similar AMR patterns [44]. One hundred twelve genes were found to be involved in virulence, dis- ease, and defence in the ISS strains [44]. Our re-analysis confirms the multi-drug resistance (MDR) to antibiotics for the ISS isolates, which is the highest among all the iso- lates. Our previous research uncovered the presence of genes associated with MDR efflux pump [44], belonging to RND (resistance, nodulation and cell division) protein family, which are reported to be the major contributors of resistance to antibiotic and other toxic compounds to the bacteria [20]. MDR has been reported to play role in the physiological function and confer resistance to sub- stances like host defense molecule and bile, which can lead to pathogenicity in humans [48]. Unlike in Singh et al. [43], we found fluoroquinolone resistance low, and null for fosfomycin. Conversely, . cereus is  gram-pos- itive bacterium commonly found in food. After infec- tion, most emetic patients recover within 24 hours, but in some cases, the toxin can be fatal via  fulminant hepatic failure [22, 34]. Overall, multi-drug resistance was found widespread in many microbes. Third, phenotypic antibiotic resistance testing data obtained from traditional antibiotic tests generated for biosafety level  strains were compared with the com- putational approaches that predicted the presence of the AMR genes, showing an excellent agreement for the antibiotics tested (Fig. 4b, ). disadvantage of the deep learning model developed by Arango-Argoty et al. [] is that the prediction can disentangle the family of antibiot- ics but not specific compounds. Many studies have shown the association between several microorganisms (bacterial, as well as phage and non-phase viral sequences) and several cancer features. Although it is unclear whether this corresponds to corre- lation or causation, the microbiome can undoubtedly be used as  cancer biomarker. For instance, certain strains of Fusobacterium sp. can be utilized as an independent diagnostic assay for colon cancer [62]. Therefore,  better understanding of the microbial communities and their degree of pathogenicity in surface-human microbiomes in space could also be useful for human health monitori- zation with detection and prognostic values in long term space travel. Rather than the gather-and-return sampling model currently used for the ISS, new developments in sequencing technologies in combination with Artificial Intelligence will allow for efficient analysis onboard the ISS and in long-duration space missions.",

We are currently collecting more data for Micro- bial Tracking- (MT-) and MT- missions. We plan to extend the AMR catalog, characterize microbial diversity, and monitor the evolution of AMR in longer time peri- ods to discover new factors involved in pathogenicity of microorganisms exposed to space conditions. Methods Metagenome Assembled Genomes (MAGs) methodology The paired-end 100-bp metagenomic reads from NCBI Short Read Archive (SRA) under the bio-project number PRJNA438545 were processed with Trimmomatic [12] to trim adapter sequences and low-quality ends, with  minimum Phred score of 20 across the entire length of the read used as  quality cut-off. Reads shorter than 80 bp were removed after trimming. Remaining high-quality\n\nPage  of 12 Madrigal et al. Microbiome (2022) 10:134 reads were subsequently assembled using metaSPAdes [37]. Contigs were binned using Metabat2 v2.11. [31]. Recovered genomes were evaluated with CheckM [39], and  recovered genome was considered good with at least 90% completeness and at most 10% contamina- tion. Each genome was subsequently annotated with the help of Rapid Annotations using Subsystems Technology (RAST), and near identifications were predicted []. Sample collection for Microbial Tracking  mission During the microbial tracking investigation to character- ize airborne and surface-associated microbial population aboard the International Space Station, samples were col- lected from ISS locations, and ground samples were col- lected from the Crew resupply vehicle. sterile polyester wipe premoistened with Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was used to collect the samples from various areas across these ISS locations, and the details and description of the sample collection and cultivation have already been reported in Checinska Sielaff et al. [14] and Singh et al. [43]. Pure isolates were selected and sub-cultured, and the sub-cultures were sequenced. Isolates from Microbial Tracking  mission To create the whole-genome sequences (WGS) of these strains, shotgun libraries were prepared using the Illu- mina Nextera Flex protocol [44], using NovaSeq 6000 S4 flow cell 2150 paired-end (PE) sequencing. Verifica- tion of the quality of the raw sequencing data was carried out using FastQC v0.11. []. Quality control for adapter trimming and quality filtering were performed using fastp v0.20. [15], and then SPAdes v3.11. [] was used to assemble all the cleaned sequences. Fastp quality control was based on the following three parameters: () correc- tion of mismatches in overlapped regions of paired-end reads, (ii) trimming of autodetected adapter sequences, and (iii) quality trimming at the 59 and 39 ends. To deter- mine the quality of the assembled sequences, the num- ber of contigs, the N50 value, and the total length were calculated using QUAST v5.. [26]. Default parameters were used for all software. The average nucleotide iden- tity (ANI) [59] was calculated using OrthoANIu by com- paring each of the scaffolds to the WGS of the respective type strains. Identification of ORFs in microbial DNA sequences Glimmer (Gene Locator and Interpolated Markov Mod- elER) v3.02 was used with default parameters to identify the coding regions and distinguish them from non- coding DNA in MAGs and MT- scaffolds that could be used as an input in DeepARG-LS. Minimum gene length was indicated as 50 bp ( glimmer3 -g50 ). Glim- mer reads DNA sequences in  FASTA file format and predicts genes in them using an Interpolated Context Model [21]. Prediction of antibiotic resistance genes in short reads and full gene length sequences DeepARG version  [],  deep learning-based approach for predicting ARGs and annotation, was run with the  --reads  option (DeepARG-SS) for NGS reads and the  --genes  option (DeepRG-LS) for longer gene-like sequences obtained with Glimmer. The DeepARG model consists of four dense hidden layers of 2000, 1000, 500, and 100 units that propagate  bit score distribution. The output layer of the deep neural network consists of 30 units that correspond to the antibiotic resistance catego- ries (102 antibiotics consolidated into 30 antibiotic cat- egories). The model was trained with  curated database of 14,933 genes from three databases (CARD, ARDB, and UNIPROT) []. Default options were used: 50% minimum percentage of identity to consider, significance of the pre- diction probability cut-off of . as recommended [], and -value of alignments (default 1e 10). The software was downloaded from https:// bitbu cket. org/ gusph dproj/  deepa rg- ss. Microbial nucleotide BLAST Nucleotide-Nucleotide BLAST .10.+ (https:// blast. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ Blast. cgi) was used to identify micro- bial species associated to MT- scaffolds. Sequences producing significant alignments were ranked and the species associated to maximum Score (bits) and mini- mum  value was deemed as the closest match. Gene annotations and pan genome analysis of MT  scaffolds  Docker image with the software tool Prokka v1.14. [42] was pulled and used with default parameters to annotate bacterial isolates. The master annotations in GFF3 format for the 226 isolates have been deposited at the Zenodo platform [DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.6518836]. Using the annotated assemblies in GFF3 format for . bugandensis and . cereus strains, Roary v3.13. was run with default parameters to compare isolates based on genes and the number of isolates they are present in. Phenotypic antibiotic resistance testing Disc assays experiments were performed and reported in Urbaniak et al. [51]. The isolates were streaked from glycerol stocks onto R2A plates. single colony was inoculated into  mL Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB) and grown overnight at 30 . Aliquots of 100   were plated on TSA. Agar diffusion discs (BD BBLTM Sensi-DiscTM, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were placed aseptically on  plate and the strains were incubated at 37   for 24 . The tested\n\nPage 10 of 12 Madrigal et al. Microbiome (2022) 10:134 antibiotics included: 30-  cefazolin (CZ-30); 30-  cefoxitin (FOX-30),    ciprofloxacin (CIP-), 15   erythromycin (-15), 10-  gentamicin (GM-10), -  oxacillin (OX), 10-  penicillin (-10), -  rifampin (RA-), and 10   tobramycin (NN-10). The diameter of inhibition zones was measured for each antibiotic disk and recorded in millimeters. The resistance results were compared with the zone diameter interpretive charts provided by the manufacturer. When the spontaneous mutants were present in response to some antibiotics, they were isolated, subcultured and tested for the specific antibiotic resistance. Data availability Raw metagenomics reads from three flights on multi- ple locations were downloaded from NASA GeneLab repository https:// genel ab. nasa. gov (GLDS-69). The ISS MAGs datasets are available at the SRA database under the accession number: PRJNA438545 [https://  www. ncbi. nlm. nih. gov/ biopr oject/ PRJNA 438545/]. Microbial tracking- (MT-) datasets (raw sequencing data and sequence assembly files) were obtained from GLDS-67, GLDS-302, GLDS-303, GLDS-309, GLDS- 311 and GLDS-350. The rest of the samples are depos- ited at DDBJ/ ENA/GenBank or are unpublished.

The aim of mice experiments in the Bion-  project was to elucidate cellular and molecular mechanisms, underlying the adaptation of key physiological systems to long-term exposure in microgravity. The studies with mice combined in vivo measurements, both in flight and post-flight (including continuous blood pressure measurement), with extensive in vitro studies carried out shortly after return of the mice and in the end of recovery study. Male C57/BL6 mice group housed in space habitats were flown aboard the Bion-  biosatellite, or remained on ground in the control experiment that replicated environmental and housing conditions in the spacecraft. Vivarium control groups were used to account for housing effects and possible seasonal differences. Mice training included the co-adaptation in housing groups and mice adaptation to paste food diet. The measures taken to co-adapt aggressive male mice in housing groups and the peculiarities of  space  paste food are described. The training program for mice designated for in vivo studies was broader and included behavioral/functional test battery and continuous behavioral measurements in the home-cage. The results of the preliminary tests were used for the selection of homogenous groups. After the flight, mice were in good condition for biomedical studies and displayed signs of pronounced disadaptation to Earth  gravity. The outcomes of the training program for the mice welfare are discussed. We conclude that our training program was effective and that male mice can be successfully employed in space biomedical research.

The principal animal species for physiological studies in this mission was the mouse (Mus musculus). Unlike more recent space experiments that used female mice, males were flown in the Bion-  mission. The challenging task of supporting mice in space for this unmanned, automated, 30-day-long mission, was made even more so by the requirement to house the males in groups. Russian biomedical research in space traditionally has em- ployed dogs, rats, monkeys, and more recently Mongolian gerbils. The flight of Laika in 1957 was one of the early dog experiments and became world famous for demonstrating that  living organism can withstand rocket launch and weightlessness, thus paving the way for the first human spaceflight. Laika  success also promoted biomedical research with other non-human animals in space that culminated with the Bion biosatellites program. total of 212 rats and 12 monkeys were launched on 11 satellites and exposed in microgravity for . 22. days between 1973 and 1997. Animal experiments on the Bion missions have contributed comprehensive data on adaptive responses of sensorimotor, cardiovascular, muscle, bone and other systems to spaceflight conditions and the mechanisms underlying these adaptations [,]. The use of mice for space experiments offers numerous advantages. Probably the most apparent one is their small size and thus the possibility of utilizing more animals per flight, thus increasing scientific output and the cost-efficiency ratio. Compar- isons of data obtained with mice, with those obtained from larger species or humans can also reveal how factors affecting adaptation to spaceflight conditions depend on the size of the organism. The mouse has become the most prevalent  mammalian model  in biomedical research, with  fully described genome and an PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org  August 2014 | Volume  | Issue  | e104830\n\nestablished role in genetically engineered mutants. While mice are preferred mammalian models for molecular biology studies, their small size is  debated limitation rather than an advantage for physiological studies. Miniaturization of scientific hardware has reduced some of the disadvantages of the species small size. Finally, the use of genetically controlled mice offers  means to reduce inter-individual variability and obtain potentially more consistent results. Despite the advantages of the mouse as  model organism for space research, their use was rather limited (apart from  number of experiments with mice during early space exploration in the 1950  and 1960 , which were aimed primarily at testing if living organisms can survive the launch or  brief exposure in microgravity) []. Flight experiments with mice were performed aboard STS-90 ( NeuroLab ), STS-108, STS-129, STS-131 ( Mouse Immunology  ), STS-133 ( Mouse Immunology II ), and STS-135 with exposure times ranging from 12 to 16 days. Research programs of these flights were largely focused on studies of muscle, bone/tendon/cartilage, nervous, and cardiovascular systems, and innate and acquired immune responses. Experiments were performed with groups of 30 or fewer female C57BL/6J mice, which were dissected typically shortly after return [ ]. The Mice Drawer System (MDS) experiment of the Italian Space Agency is by far the longest spaceflight of mice to date [10]. In this mission,  mice were exposed for 91 days aboard the International Space Station. The advantages offered by the possibility of genetic manipulations with mice were utilized in this experiment; three mice were transgenic with pleiotrophin overex- pression (C57BLJ10/ PTN) and three mice were their wild-type counterparts. The MDS habitats required periodic replenishment and servicing by by astronauts. Sadly, half of the mice died during the course of this mission due to various estimated reasons. In the present paper we aim to present  brief overview of the Bion-  mission scientific goals and experimental design. Of particular interest we will focus on the program of mouse training and selection for the experiments, and some outcomes of the Bion-   mission. Overview of the Bion-  mission The scientific program of the Bion-  project was aimed at obtaining data on mechanisms of adaptation of muscle, bone, cardiovascular, sensorimotor and nervous systems to prolonged exposure in microgravity and during post-flight recovery. To this aim, functional measurements in vivo were combined with complementary morphological, biochemical, cellular and molec- ular studies performed in vitro. To our knowledge, Bion-  is the first study with mice to follow the dynamics of re-adaptation to normal gravity or to assess post-flight in vivo functions. The in vivo measurements in-flight included video recording of mice behavior and continuous recording of arterial pressure during all stages of the flight. After the flight, testing of animal behavior, memory and learning, vestibular function, physical activity, strength and fitness, as well as continuous registration of cardiovascular parameters were performed. The set of in vivo measurements was designed to provide data on the effects of microgravity on the physiological systems of interest, and to follow the time course of re-adaptation to Earth  gravity after the flight. To reduce the possibility of inadvertently stressing the mice with numerous post-flight tests and thus obscuring the effects of spaceflight, the decision was made to monitor mice in their home cage using an automated data collection system (TSE Pheno- Master) and implantable telemetry, while reducing the number of tests [11]. The program had to be performed with  limited number of animals; thus the use of  repeated measures design. Mice were tested before and after the flight (or its simulation on- ground) [12]. The in vitro studies were focused on metabolism and the structure and function of tissues from microgravity-exposed mice. More specifically, the individual studies were selected to maximize the scientific yield and targeted the impact of microgravity and other factors specific to spaceflight on biochemical, morphological and, primarily, cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the adaptation of main physiological systems, such as the central nervous system, sensory systems, skeletal muscle, supporting tissues, including bone and connective tissues, cardiovascular, respiratory, digestive, neuroendocrine and immune systems. The following organs and tissues were harvested: brain structures, vestibular organs, retina and crystalline lens, spinal cord, muscles of hind limbs and back, vertebral column, fore and hind paw bones, articular and cartilage structures, ligaments, bone marrow, cardiac muscle, arteries from brain and hind legs, lung, intestines, liver, kidney, spleen, thymus, skin, salivary glands, testis and blood. These samples were analyzed using morphological (light and electron microscopy, histochemistry and immunohisto- chemistry), biochemical and  variety of molecular-biology techniques (enzyme-linked immune assays, high-pressure liquid chromatography, western-blot, real-time PCR, whole-genome gene expression). Functional properties of skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle and resistive arteries samples were evaluated using myography and atomic force microscopy. Mice for in vitro studies were euthanized by cervical dislocation; because of the diversity and number of studies, this method was chosen as the common procedure to reduce variability and one that provided the least interference with the objectives of the in vitro studies. Materials and Methods Ethical statement The study was approved by IACUC of MSU Institute of Mitoengineering (Protocol No  35,  November, 2012) and of Biomedical Ethics Commission of IBMP (protocol No  319,  April, 2013) and conducted in compliance with the European Conven- tion for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experi- mental and Other Scientific Purposes [13]. Animals Experiments were performed with C57BL/6N male mice. The choice of strain was based on the requirements of the tissue harvesting program participants and the fact that C57/BL6 is one of the most widely used strains. The selection of male mice was based on the same requirement. The advantages offered by using males are their substantially larger size and the absence of sex steroid cycling compared to females; the vast majority of animal research is conducted using males, so their use in this study made the results more readily comparable to the data in the published literature. Nevertheless, the risks associated with group-housing mature males were recognized and greatly affected the prepara- tory procedures. It was decided that the optimal age of mice at launch was   months, when the males were still young but fully mature. The growth rate in mice is known to slow down by this age, and obesity, which C57/BL6 mice are prone to exhibit, is not yet considered  factor. Space environment affects microorganisms by increasing their virulence; major shifts in immune status in space are well documented [,].",

Space environment affects microorganisms by increasing their virulence; major shifts in immune status in space are well documented [,]. It is reasonable to think that even pseudo pathogenic species may increase morbidity during prolonged exposure in space [14,15]. These considerations underscored the necessity for the use of specific pathogen-free mice in the Mice in Bion-  Space Mission PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org  August 2014 | Volume  | Issue  | e104830\n\nexperiments,  side benefit of this approach being the reduced variability of data obtained in SPF-animals [16]. Male C57BL/6N mice ( = 300) weighing 22 25  were purchased from the Animal Breeding Facility - Branch of Shemyakin & Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry. Mice were specific pathogen free. The main site for mouse training was the animal facility of Moscow State University  Institute of Mitoengineering. At the time of launch and the start of the related control experiments, the mice were 19 20 weeks old. Mice were individually identified using RFID chips (El1000, Felixcan, Spain) and earmarks. Routine manipulations of the mice consisted of daily handling, examination, and weighing. Experimental groups The Bion-  biosatellite, launched on April 19, 2013 from cosmodrome Baikonur, and the descent module landed on May 19, 2013 in the vicinity of Orenburg, successfully fulfilling the plan for an unmanned, 30-day-long orbital spaceflight. Housing and climate parameters were replicated in the subsequent ground control (GC) experiment (July 26 to August 26, 2013). total of  experimental groups were used for the flight and ground control experiments ( = 45 per group). An additional fifth group included the backup mice for the main flight group ( = 45). Mice of the space flight group (SF) were exposed to microgravity for 30 days. Concurrent with the SF mice, another group of 45 mice remained in the animal facility (SFV). The ground control (GC) experiment was conducted, after the landing, in the refurbished BOS flight habitats. The habitats were installed in  climatic chamber that replicated the temperature, humidity, gas composition and other flight-specific climate parameters. The corresponding vivarium control (GCV) mice were housed in the animal facility. The separate and concurrent GCV groups were used to account for possible seasonal differences between SF and GC mice. Each of the groups (SF, GC, SFV, GCV and backup SF mice) included mice designated for in vivo studies and recovery ( = 10) and mice for dissection and in vitro measurements ( = 35). Each in vivo study subgroup, in its turn, consisted of  mice implanted with telemetry probes to monitor blood pressure and  intact animals. Mice were handled and trained before the flight and ground control experiments. Basically, training consisted of shaping the groups of three mice each for social housing and adaptation to paste diet. The training of mice designated for in vivo studies was more comprehensive. It started with implanting the telemetry probes and, following recovery,  set of preliminary behavioral and functional tests (Figure , Table  and ). Housing The BOS habitats were designed to house up to three mice per group [17]. Stable cohorts of three mice were maintained throughout the training program and consequent experiments, with the exception of brief periods of post-surgery recovery (  days) and behavioral tests ( days), when they were housed individually. Individually ventilated cages (GM 500, Techniplast, floor area 500 cm2) were used. Techniplast mice shelters (red plastic triangles, 15Lx11Wx8H cm), paper tubes and paper tissues for nesting material were provided to enrich the environment. Cage cleaning was done once weekly, and water was refreshed twice weekly. All materials were sterilized prior to use by autoclave. Techniques aimed to prevent animal contamination were thor- oughly followed. Habitats The hardware for mice housing in-flight was an adapted version of the habitats used for rats in the original Bion program. It was developed by Biofizpribor, according to the IBMP requirements and was tested by IBMP in 2011. Each block consisted of five individual habitats (BOS, Block Obespecheniya Soderzhaniya, Russian for - literally - Unit for the Provision of Housing). The living compartment of each habitat was an acrylic cylinder 9862 mm in diameter and 200610 mm in length with  total volume of approximately . (Figure ). stainless steel feeder ( ml) was mounted at one end (the  top ) of the cylinder. The feeder had  flap, used in the refill procedure. The food distribution system (except for the feeders) was common to all five habitats in the block. Paste  space  food was pumped from the container and distributed between individual habitats of the assembly  times daily (every  hours at 00:00, 04:00, 08:00, 12:00, 16:00 and 20:00),  total of 54 /day per  mice. Food distribution was adjusted through manipulations of pressure developed in the container and in the feeders to follow this pattern prior to experiments. Bulbs for day-phase (08:00 20:00, 4565 Lux) and night-phase (20:00 08:00, 562 Lux) lighting, an air supply fan (. /) and an air distribution system were positioned on one side of the cylinder. video camera was installed between the light bulbs; video was recorded  times daily (simultaneously with feeding, each session lasted  hours) at  frames per second. The opposite side of the cylinder had the grid for waste removal. The waste removal system was individual for each habitat. The door at the  bottom  of the cylinder had  glass window. In order to minimize impact of variability arising from possible differences in mice housing conditions, experimental subgroups were formed from mice that were housed in different habitats. Air composition and climate parameters in the satellite were maintained by the centralized life support system and remained in the designed range throughout the flight. Diet During the initial stage of training, mice were provided with standard pelleted food (Assortiment Agro, Russia) and deionized water given ad libitum. Two weeks prior to launch, and the start of the GC experiment, the animals were adapted to the flight paste food diet. Both the paste and standard diets (pelleted food and water) were first presented together; after   days the water bottle was removed, followed in another   days by the removal of the pelleted food. Vivarium control (SFV and GCV) groups were fed standard chow and water throughout the experiments. The  space  paste food diet was developed at IBMP by . Gurieva and . Mednikova. It was produced based on the standard chow, with water and casein as gelling agent added. Consumption of standard pelleted chow and water (in SFV and GCV) or paste diet (in SF and GC) was monitored daily for ten days in ten randomly chosen cages per group. Data for the cage was averaged across the days and expressed as  per 10  bodyweight. separate preliminary experiment in metabolic chambers was conducted to quantify urination in mice fed standard chow and paste food. Four groups of mice, of  mice each, were housed in metabolic chambers (Techniplast, Italy) and fed pelleted food (grinded) or paste food. Body weight, food and water consumption, urine volume and feces weight were monitored daily ( days for each diet).

The hardware was adapted and integrated to the Bion- biosatellite by engineers from Biofizpribor (St. Petersburg, Russia) and the Centre national   tudes spatiales (CNES, France). Miniature probes (model PA- C10) weighing . were implanted  weeks before the start of experiments, following the manufacturer  instructions. The catheter of the probe was implanted into the left carotid so that its tip just reached the aorta [18]. The body of the transmitter was implanted subcutaneously on the flank, briefly described below. Mice were anaesthetized by an intraperitoneal injection of  solution containing tiletamine/zolazepam (15 mg/kg each) com- bined with xylazine ( mg/kg). Depth of anesthesia was assessed regularly by hind leg pinch and observation of respiration rate, and maintained by additional dose() of the mixture (about 20% of the initial dose) as needed. midline incision was made on the ventral neck. The carotid artery was separated and ligated    mm cranially to its bifurcation. second ligature was used to suspend the artery   mm proximal to the site of ligation. Through  small incision in the artery wall, the catheter was advanced   mm towards the aorta and fixed in place with sutures and acrylic glue. subcutaneous pocket on the flank of the animal was made with blunt scissors, and the transmitter was inserted there with  small hemostat. The catheter and the transmitter were fixed in place with acrylic glue and the skin incision closed with absorbable sutures. During the recovery period, mice were housed individually; they were under daily veterinarian control and received ibuprofen  mg/ml and Bactrim  mg/ml in drinking water. Figure . Schematic diagram of the experiments. Mice of SF, SFV and backup SF groups were co-adapted in housing groups of  mice each, SF mice were adapted to paste food diet, and mice of in vivo subgroups passed through preliminary tests. After transportation to and adaptation at Baikonur, SF mice were flown aboard the Bion-  satellite for 30 days. After landing mice were examined and transported to Moscow, where animals of the in vitro subgroup were dissected, while recovery dynamics was followed in the in-vivo subgroup before dissection  days after landing.

On the morning of day  mice  battery of behavioral and functional tests was administered. First, animals were examined for visible abnormalities in exterior and simple reflexes [19]. The Open field test was performed in  round, 60 cm arena of black plastic with  grey floor and 40 cm high walls [20]. Mouse behavior was video recorded at 25 fps for 10 minutes under  bright white light (200 Lux) followed by 10 min in darkness (IR light). Videos were analyzed for locomotor activity and other behavioral parameters using EthoVision . . (Noldus). Grip force was measured using Grass FT-03 force transducer [21]. Analog output was amplified, digitized at  kHz sampling rate and analyzed using PowerGraph software (InteropticaS, Russia). RotaRod test was conducted using UgoBasil hardware with rotation speed increased from  to 50 rpm in  min,  trials were performed with each mouse [22]. On the evening of the same day, animals were placed into cages of Phenomaster (TSE Instruments, Germany), an automated data collection system, where they were monitored for  days. The system was equipped with an infrared grid to register animal activity, scales for the water bottle and feeder,  running wheel with unrestricted access and rotation counter, an  operant wall  for positively reinforced operant conditioning [23]. There were 16 such cages, housing mice individually. Measures were read once per minute using TSE software. Blood pressure and heart rate in mice, instrumented with telemetry probes were continuously recorded throughout the tests. Operant conditioning sessions were conducted automatically, once  day and started at 22:30, controlled by IntelliMaze software control. The first session was designed to reinforce nosepokes emitted by an animal while both light stimuli (left and right) were active. This session was used to establish individual baseline tendencies to display nosepokes to the right or left. On subsequent days, mice were trained to direct nosepokes to the side opposite to their initial bias. The number of rewarded responses was limited to 50; each sweetened dry milk pellet weighed 14 mg. To promote learning, mice were maintained at 90% ad lib body weight. Access Table . Key dates of the on-ground control experiment.

Reward pellets were the alternative source of food. The quality of blood pressure signal (for the operated mice), probabilities of running wheel use, combined with performance in conditioning task were used as criteria for inclusion into experimental groups. Selected mice were randomly assigned to either flight or ground control or vivarium groups. Transportation The groups of mice designated for flight were transported to Cosmodrome Baikonur one week before launch. Transportation was by car and by air in several steps and lasted approximately 24 . Containers of nontransparent blue plastic 40660 cm with  sub-compartments (each for  group of three mice) equipped with air filters (Animal Breeding Facility - Branch of Shemyakin & Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry) were used. Paste food was provided to mice during transportation. Statistical analysis One-way ANOVA (transportation bodyweight data) followed by Bonferroni  multiple comparisons was performed with transportation bodyweight data. In order the pre/post flight bodyweight data set met the assumptions of normality and homoscedasticity intrinsic to the ANOVA model, rank transfor- mation was applied to the entire set of observations [24] prior to two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-hoc comparisons; noteworthy, the results of the test on raw and transformed data were identical. Fisher  exact test (survival), Man-Whitney -test (home cage food and water consumption, open field test behavioral data) or paired Student  -test (metabolic chambers data) was performed using GraphPad Prism software (version .00 for MacOS, GraphPad Software, USA). Results and Discussion Group housing Living conditions for animals considered optimal on earth cannot be provided in the confines of  space satellite. Microgravity, apart from purely technical limitations of the housing hardware, may disrupt normal mouse behavior, and an inability to express natural behavior is posited as  potential cause of distress in laboratory animals [25]. This and more obvious negative factors, such as accumulated waste, suboptimal feeding regimen etc., can negatively affect mice and could increase aggressiveness in space habitats. As  result we considered aggressive interactions  major risk factor. To minimize this risk, we specifically sought to shape the groups for social housing and carefully select stable groups prior to experiments. From an initial set of 300 male mice, 88 groups of  mice were formed,  total of 53 groups were used for the space flight (SF) experiment and corresponding SFV, 35 groups for subsequent GC and GCV studies (87%). During the co-adaptation period,  total of 12 groups had to be rearranged (14%). Male mice are known to have aggressive tendencies. Their aggressiveness depends on  number of factors, including strain (C57/BL6 is considered one of the more aggressive strains), living space and other housing conditions and, in the case of group housing, the history of group interactions is  major factor [17]. In an animal facility, aggressive interactions are easily overcome by simply removing the aggressor from  group or by individual housing of mature males. Individual housing, however, precludes all social interactions and thus compromises the animals  overall welfare. For this reason, environmental enrichment is often employed in animal facilities, with the goal of reducing aggressive interactions. While the analysis of measures promoting co-habitation of male mice was beyond the scope of the current project, several pertinent observations were made. We reasoned that environmental enrichment and daily handling were critically important for successful co-adaptation of mice and the development of sustainable hierarchy in the group. In  preliminary experiment, when no environmental enrichment was used, only 50% of mice (out of  sample of 42) successfully co-adapted to living in groups of three. The enrichment used to prepare mice for the Bion-  experiments (shelters, nesting material and paper tubes) proved to be useful in two ways. Shelter with good qualities is salient to mice, and male mice will compete for the resource [26]. Additionally, adequate shelter facilitates the observation of nesting behavior within the group. Nesting behavior can differentiate groups, with stable groups building  communal nest within  chamber, whereas mice that cannot co-adapt as  group compete and fight for the shelter, with one or two mice building  separate nest outside of the chamber. Handling and other simple manipulations are known to induce an acute stress reaction in mice, seen as an increase in blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and plasma corticosterone [27 30]. At the same time, handling is often used to habituate mice and rats to experimental manipulations (mild stress), with different handling techniques having different impacts on their behavioral indices [31]. In the course of training for the experiments, mice were handled daily to monitor signs of fighting and body weight, and to help identify the provokers and recipients of aggression. Frequent handling proved critically important to condition and calm mice to some of the tests. For instance, the  air righting  test used to evaluate vestibular function involved holding and rotating individual mice cupped in the palms of the experimenter  hands prior to releasing the mouse into  safe fall. Extensive handling and homecage enrichments yielded male mice that were tractable and cooperative during such potentially provocative procedures. Other, useful and informative observa- tions could be made after  change of bedding. Mice become extremely active when placed in  fresh cage. We have repeatedly observed that in unstable groups mice would fight promptly after  change of bedding. In summary, fighting episodes observed after handling or cage cleaning, along with an absence of  communal nest, were treated as indication that the group had to be either rearranged or split and excluded from the experiments. Food and water consumption The average pelleted food consumption in SFV and GCV groups was .3060.14 /10  bodyweight (BW) and their water consumption was .5260.65 /10  BW (m6sd). Average paste food consumption in the Space Flight and the Ground Control groups was .5260.88 /10  BW. Taking into account the 76  78%, water content of paste food, dry weight consumed was the same as that for pelleted food of .2760.20 /10  BW ( = .4514, Mann Whitney test). Notably, water intake via the paste food diet was .2560.67 /10  BW, or roughly three times ad libitum water consumption, when water was presented separately from dry, pelleted diet (,.0001, Mann Whitney test). Apparently the need for nutrients, rather than thirst, governed the paste food consumption.",

Apparently the need for nutrients, rather than thirst, governed the paste food consumption. While no adverse impact of this increased water intake was evident, mice maintained on paste diet produced more urine that was more dilute than normal. When paste food was introduced, water consumption decreased roughly  times its original amount; body weight increased by .560. , and feces weight tripled Mice in Bion-  Space Mission PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org  August 2014 | Volume  | Issue  | e104830\n\n(Figure ). Measured urine production in mice fed pasted food diet was . ml/10  BW, which was 10 times the value in mice fed standard diet (Student  paired  = 12.55, df = ,  = .0011). Telemetry probes impact on the mice welfare Continuous blood pressure measurement, with implantable telemetry probes, was an integral part of the in vivo studies. The health status and functional state of the implanted mice were carefully monitored after surgery because the novelty of this procedure as part of  long spaceflight constituted  major risk factor for the mission. Thirty-five (35) mice were implanted with PA-C10 blood pressure transmitters. The mice tolerated with apparent ease telemetry probe implantation. As can be seen from body weight data, the acute recovery was complete by day  post-surgery (Figure ). At approximately the same time, mice were behavior- ally recovered in terms of locomotor activity and nest building, and were reunited with their co-habitants. Tests of corneal, pineal and other simple reflexes, performance on RotaRod, grip strength, running wheel performance, and learning and memory tests revealed no adverse effects of probe implantation. We occasionally noted, slight eyelid drooping. Although this ptosis could be interpreted as indicating compro- mised brain blood supply, we do not believe this was the case. Indeed, the circle of Willis is incompletely developed in mice, with 10% incidence in the C57 strain [32]; the right common carotid artery was ligated during the surgery. The absence of impaired motor or cognitive functions in implanted mice contradicts interpretations of brain blood supply deficiency. An extracranial blood supply through the external carotid could, however, be compromised in operated mice, particularly in the most distal branches of the artery that supply blood to the eyelid. We surmise that was the reason for the slight ptosis observed on the side ipsilateral to the carotid ligation. Mice that underwent surgery were housed individually during acute recovery period ( days on average) and were re-introduced to their co-habitants when recovered. Two modes of reunion were tested. One method was to introduce two un-operated mice to the cage of an operated animal. This was designed to exploit  host- intruder  paradigm and offer an advantage to the host (operated =  weak  mouse) due to concerns for its safety. In nearly all cases, however, the non-operated  intruders  were the ones to suffer, when the implanted mouse assumed the dominant position. The second method was to introduce all three mice to  fresh cage; this was found to be safe for both operated and intact mice. Based on in vivo tests conducted before the experiment, we selected the latter mode of reunion. To summarize, when partially recovered from the operation, mice with implanted probes can be easily group-housed with intact mice and display little (if any) differences from mice without surgery. Pre-flight training of mice designated for in vivo studies Preliminary training and tests were performed with 42 mice for both the flight (SF) experiment and the corresponding vivarium Figure .

Here, it is important to mention that probabilities of fulfilling each of the criteria are below . The probabilities of mice displaying  good BP signal, running vigorously in the wheel, performing well in discriminative learning, and maintaining amicable interactions with cagemates should be treated as independent and therefore should be multiplied to get the joint probability. Although the rule is common knowledge, it is easy to overlook when planning an experiment, and anticipating sufficient allowance of extra animals. Transportation The flight group of mice was transported to Cosmodrome Baikonur one week before launch. The relatively long (24 ) transportation to Baikonur did not seriously affect the mice as evidenced by  slight bodyweight change of 23% (20. , Figure ). Bodyweight returned back to pre-transportation values in two days. General Outcomes Climate The environmental parameters in the biosatellite during the orbital mission, in the climatic chamber during the ground control experiment, and in the animal facility for the VC groups (Table ), were closely matched and within the acceptable range for the housing of rodents [33,34]. The climate parameters aboard the satellite were within the designed range throughout the flight [35].

It should be noted that loss of all mice ( = 15) in one assembly during space flight was  result of  gross malfunction of the food distribution system. Taking into account that the flight was aimed at exposing mice in the microgravity at, rather than evaluating the long established habitat system, survivorship would be calculated as 16 out of 30 mice (53%). Loss of mice in the SF group was obviously higher than in GC (, .0001, Fisher  exact test); however, the results of the control experiment are in concordance with data obtained during preliminary evaluation of the system, where none of the 15 mice died during  30-day housing in the habitats ( = .1760, Fisher  exact test). Though the comparison of mice survival in our 30-day automated mission with the data obtained in the 91-day MDS experiment aboard the ISS, where astronauts attended to the mice and survival rate was 50% ( out of ), might be dubious, numerically the values do coincide. Upon examination of the surviving SF mice,  (25%) had limb injuries and  (38%) had various tail injuries. These results were quite unexpected taking into account that, during the preliminary evaluation of the system, all the mice remained in perfect health after 30 days of housing in the habitats. Mice behavior during the flight To better understand and interpret the fatalities and injuries sustained by some of the mice in the two functioning habitat assemblies, we made use of the uniquely rich video data that were recorded from the Bion habitats (see description, above). It should be noted that never before have such extensive video records been collected and that this design feature alone could earn the  modernization  tag in the Bion-M1 designation. The library of video recordings from the two habitat assemblies consisted of ,476, 30-min segments of individual habitats, captured during both light and dark phases of each day of the mission, as described earlier. As might be expected, video quality was superior in the early phases of the flight and visibility was compromised over time, as floating liquids and debris tended to obscure the camera lens and the general atmosphere of the habitats. More specifically, at the beginning of first week of space flight we categorized as clear with maximal visibility 76% of the video segments. There was  precipitous decrease in visibility at the beginning of the ensuing weeks: the proportion of such clear segments was only % and % for the 2nd and 3rd weeks, respectively. On the first day of the final week none (%) of the habitats were clearly visible in the video records. Two fatalities occurred in different habitats on the 2nd day of the flight. In another cage, one mouse died on the 9th day. There was no evidence of fighting, biting, or agonistic behavior in any of the video samples, so we do not believe that any of deaths or injuries resulted from aggression among the males, evidencing success of our effort to train and select stable housing groups. The first two losses occurred early in the flight, so lack of access to food cannot account for them; and again, in no habitat was there visual evidence of competition that prevented access to food. What might help explain the deaths? The video records clearly showed that the mice spent much time in physical contact (huddling) with one another and, significantly we think, they were grouped against the flat, feeder wall of the cylindrical habitat (Figure ). We quantified their location within each habitat on select days during the flight; choosing days on which the video segments provided good available visibility. Because we were interested in the aggregative behavior of the mice in different areas, we encoded when there were three, two or one individuals in contact with the feeder wall, the blank wall, or were in the middle area of the habitat. When one mouse was in contact with  flat wall (feeder or blank) and one or more mice were in contact with it but not necessarily with the wall itself, we scored such aggregation as being in wall contact. Using these criteria we found that during the 1st day of flight, two or three mice were aggregated at the feeder wall for 80% (median value; range: 63% 100%) of the observable segments. They spent % of the time at the blank wall.",

Individuals were often seen oriented toward the food area, which was recessed  cm. Whether the behavioral orientation reflected active feeding of the paste diet, or thigmotactic responses to the recess, or grasping of an edge created by the recess or presented by the rotating flap, or some combination of such factors was not discernible from the videos. It was clear, however, that both under - and microgravity conditions, the animals spent most of their aggregative time, which was considerable, near or in contact with the feeder wall. In microgravity, the animals assumed  greater range of orientations at the wall and may have more actively inserted their bodies into the recesses or crevasses created by the hardware, especially the moving parts. This remains supposition, but appears likely and should be considered in future designs as well as in the arrangements for video surveillance during future flights. Results obtained in the Bion-  mission should be taken into account in design of new mice habitats for future space missions. Despite the general design has long since proven its efficiency in the previous Bion flights with rats, including use of paste food and the system of its distribution, further development is needed to better adapt it for mice based on this study; obviously any moving parts in direct access of the animals should be excluded. The advantage of the habitats design is its ability to support mice without any human interference in relatively long duration missions. This degree of autonomy has not been reached by any other of the existing animal habitats, for instance, in the recent MDS mission the water tank had to be refilled every 10 days, and while food supply was designed to operate automatically for 60 days, eventually the food bars had to be manually advanced as needed by the astronauts [10]. Examination at the landing site Examination of mice after the Bion-  flight directly at the landing site (return + ) revealed gross motor function impair- ment: the mice could not maintain steady posture and their fore and hind paws were positioned more to their sides, rather than directly under their trunk (14 of 16, 88%); the mice did not move even when prodded; when lifted, the mice spread their toes excessively (16/16, 100%) and righting reaction was absent or impaired in an aerial righting test ( of , 100%). Some recovery of locomotor function was evident by about    after landing, when the mice could keep normal posture and even rear. All mice were found to be exophthalmic. Excessive urinations with almost colorless urine were noted in 14 out of 16 mice. Body weight data The nutritional status of mice post-flight was variable. Whereas the majority of mice either gained some weight or maintained their pre-flight values (12/16, 75%),  mouse was famished (BW 50% below pre-flight value), and  were distinctly overweight by 30 40%. The differences in bodyweight between spaceflight, ground control and vivarium control groups were not significant ( (,104) = .40,  = .2468) and they accounted for only % of total variation (Figure ). Post-hoc comparisons revealed no differences between the groups before the experiments. The comparison of pre- versus post-flight values revealed that bodyweight increased in the flight group (%,  = .0010), ground control (%,  = .0456) and control vivarium groups (11%, ,.0001) with overall effect of  time  being highly significant ((,104) = 59.79, ,.0001). The relations of main experimental groups (flight and control experiment groups) to the corresponding vivarium controls were mirrored: while the flight group had gained, on average, more than the mice housed in the animal facility, mice from the control experiment group gained less weight than their vivarium control counterparts. We consider that this discrepancy is explained by little opportunity for exercise in the relatively small habitats in microgravity, and partial loss of mice during the flight experiment, leading to excesses of food available to the survivors. In the control experiment, where the effort was made to reproduce the feeding regimen observed in the flight experiment, given that more mice survived, the relative amount of food per mouse was smaller leading to smaller weight gain. Seasonal variations in growth cannot be ruled out either. Behavior in the open-field test Behavioral activity of individual mice in the open field was recorded during the training period prior to the start of the experiments and one day after landing (SF and SFV), and at corresponding times for the control groups (GC and GCV); the software for behavioral analyses extracted the nine parameters in Table . After return from 30-day spaceflight mice were markedly less active, with both distance (Figure 8A, ) and rearing frequency (Figure 8D) drastically reduced compared to either GC or SFV animals, whereas grooming duration (Figure 8H) was much higher in SF mice compared to any of the control groups. Interestingly, both SF and GC mice who were housed in relatively small habitats displayed more pronounced thigmotaxis compared to mice kept in standard cages (SFV or GCV correspondingly), as evidenced by  decrease of center zone entries (Figure 8E), time spent in center (Figure 8F) and distance moved in center zone, while latency to the first entry into the center zone was increased in SF mice only (Figure 8G). Behavior parameters of mice from two vivarium groups, SFV and GCV, were indistinguishable. The drastic decrease in activity by SF mice in this test is obviously related to adverse impact of prolonged 30-days spaceflight on the sensorimotor systems of these animals. In part, housing within the restricted confines of the habitats decreased the propensity of the mice to enter and explore the center of the arena; such observations are usually interpreted in terms of increased anxiety in these animals compared to cage-housed controls [20]. Compared the flight habitat interior, animals maintained in the Figure . representative photograph of mice in the flight habitats.

Because OFT activity is known to decrease with repetitive tests, the repeated testing approach used in this study could potentially obscure the effects of spaceflight. Nevertheless, the opposite was true. While some of the measures taken before the flight, .., distance moved, were very close in different experimental groups with variation coefficients ranging between 16 and 30%, others differed between the groups and were quite variable within the group, .. latency to enter central zone with within group coefficient of variation of 70 110% (Table ). In order to reduce this inter-individual and seasonal variability, results of preliminary testing were used to make the correction for baseline differences; this transformation made possible differenti- ation of spaceflight and habitat effects (Figure ). Post-flight adjustment of experimental groups Due to the partial loss of mice during the flight, the number of animals in other groups had to be adjusted (Table ). The number of control mice (GC, SFV, GCV) for in vitro studies was decreased proportionately to the number of SF animals available. This decision was made basing on the relatively small variability of the measures to be taken in inbred C57 mice [12] and time considerations (complete dissection of one animal lasted . . hours and dissection of all the mice took more than 24 hours). Taking that accidental death of mice in flight was  random event and that bodyweight data from all the animals was available, the mice for control groups were selected to match the initial bodyweight of SF mice. Different tactics were chosen for the in vivo subgroups. The behavioral data were characterized by high variability, at the same time all the animals designated for in vivo studies underwent preliminary testing and selection, taking this into account the number of mice for in vivo studies was not altered in order to obtain  better estimate of the behavioral parameters in the batch of mice used and to increase the power of the planned analyses. Implementation of the scientific program Despite significant loss of animals in flight, the scientific program was not abridged and was implemented in full. Hemodynamic and behavioral data were collected throughout the flight. Dissection of SF and SFV mice started 12 hours after landing on May 20th, 2013. Recovery was followed for  days in the in vivo subgroup of SF mice and the dissection of these animals was performed on May 26. Joint effort of teams from Russia, USA, France, Germany, Italy and Ukraine who took part in the in vivo studies and tissue-sharing program resulted in over 70 distinct hypothesis-driven studies. Conclusions The Bion-  flight was unique in many ways, particularly the unprecedented duration of an automated mission with living animals. The sex of the mice was male, thus imposing greater attention to creation and selection of stable groups of mice for social housing. The overall success was evident: aggressive interactions were noted on single occasions and under conditions of starvation only. The use of male animals is obviously required for research in male reproduction and their larger size compared to females offered clear advantages. Our program of mice training for flight and control experiments of the Bion-  project was aimed to: ensure that mice adapt to stressful conditions of space flight when housed in groups; to collect baseline data from these mice; select homogenous groups; and, more generally, to promote collection of less variable data. The results of our program presented here demonstrate that group housed male mice need not be excluded  priori, but quite on the contrary, can be successfully employed in space biomedical research if clear and simple procedures provided by this study are followed. The failures in this project were connected with hardware malfunction in food distribution system and to microgravity- related changes in mouse behavior. Some of the injuries and deaths encountered in this pioneering effort suggest moving parts within the habitat present potential risks and should be avoided or carefully analyzed in the design of future mouse habitats. In this space experiment we have, for the first time, introduced implantable telemetry in these small laboratory animals. This shift to data collection during the flight became possible with the development of miniature implantable probes, thereby dramati- cally increasing the scientific output of such experiments. Moreover, the use of an automated data collection system during the post-flight stage of this experiment provided comprehensive data on the course and mechanism of recovery of varied physiological systems following exposure to microgravity. The unprecedented inclusion of daily video recordings proved valuable for scientific purposes, for animal welfare considerations, and for assessing both nominal and aberrant events. The good condition of spaceflight mice was the basis for the positive results of both the recovery and tissue sharing studies; leading us to conclude that our training program was generally effective. We express our hope that the results and considerations presented here will be useful for the planning of future missions and will help to ensure the welfare of rodents in space research. Table .

Homeostasis in bone occurs through  balance in the activities and signaling of osteoclasts, osteoblasts, and osteocytes, as well as proliferation and differentiation of their stem cell progenitors. Microgravity and unloading are known to cause osteoclast-mediated bone resorption; however, we hypothesize that osteocytic osteolysis, and cell cycle arrest during osteogenesis may also contribute to bone loss in space. To test this possibility, we exposed 16- week-old female C57BL/6J mice ( = ) to microgravity for 15-days on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Analysis of the pelvis by mCT shows decreases in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of .29%, and bone thickness of 11.91%. TRAP-positive osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces also increased in microgravity by 170% ( = .004), indicating osteoclastic bone degeneration. High-resolution -ray nanoCT studies revealed signs of lacunar osteolysis, including increases in cross- sectional area (+17%,  = .022), perimeter (+14%,  = .008), and canalicular diameter (+%,  = .037). Expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) , , and 10 in bone, as measured by RT-qPCR, was also up-regulated in microgravity (+12.94, +.98 and +16.85 fold respectively, ,.01), with MMP10 localized to osteocytes, and consistent with induction of osteocytic osteolysis. Furthermore, expression of CDKN1a/p21 in bone increased .31 fold (,.01), and was localized to osteoblasts, possibly inhibiting the cell cycle during tissue regeneration as well as conferring apoptosis resistance to these cells. Finally the apoptosis inducer Trp53 was down-regulated by 21.54 fold (,.01), possibly associated with the quiescent survival-promoting function of CDKN1a/p21. In conclusion, our findings identify the pelvic and femoral region of the mouse skeleton as an active site of rapid bone loss in microgravity, and indicate that this loss is not limited to osteoclastic degradation. Therefore, this study offers new evidence for microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis, and CDKN1a/p21-mediated osteogenic cell cycle arrest.

Introduction On Earth, at  , mechanical loading of mammalian tissues is an important factor in maintaining tissue health and promoting normal regenerative growth. Forces generated by gravity such as hydrostatic pressure, stretch, and fluid shear are well known to promote normal tissue growth and repair mechanisms. Converse- ly, during spaceflight, gravity-generated forces are absent and the mechanical stimulation of tissues is greatly diminished. Direct and immediate physiological responses to microgravity-induced me- chanical unloading include adaptive losses of bone [,,,,,] and muscle mass [,,,10], and alterations in cardiovascular function [11,12,13,14]. Because of practical reasons, most space biological animal research has focused on the short-term effects of spaceflight, and thus our understanding of long-term effects of microgravity exposure is very limited. However, it is likely that over long periods of time mechanical unloading in microgravity may continue to affect tissue regenerative growth and repair, resulting in more widespread degenerative effects. Alternatively, it is also possible that cells and tissues may adapt to microgravity and reach  new homeostatic level appropriate for health maintenance under reduced mechanical load conditions. Since normal tissue repair and regeneration is dependent on the ability of adult stem cells to proliferate and differentiate, we have hypothesized that during long-term spaceflight, the reduction in gravity mechano- stimulation may decrease regenerative proliferation and differen- tiation of tissue-specific adult stem cells. This in turn may have significant health consequences for multiple tissues throughout the body, including bone. Specifically for bone tissue, short-duration exposure to micro- gravity rapidly leads to alterations in bone mineral content, cellular dynamics, and gene expression patterns [15,16,17,18,19]. This is illustrated by   % loss of skeletal mineral in weight- PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org  April 2013 | Volume  | Issue  | e61372\n\nbearing bones per month [17], which poses significant risks for long-duration and interplanetary missions. Because bone remod- eling homeostasis depends on tightly coupled mineral deposition and resorption [20,21], uncoupling of these processes in micro- gravity can cause increased and rapid bone resorption by osteoclasts, and decreased bone formation by osteoblasts [17,18,22,23]. Increased osteoclast bone resorptive activity has been documented within the first several days of spaceflight [,17] and may be reduced after  period of transition and adaptation to microgravity. However, of potentially more importance to long duration missions in microgravity is the reported reduction of bone formation by osteoblasts in growing rats [24,25,26], although, this result has not been reproduced. In skeletally mature animals, this bone formation arrest may translate into an impairment of regenerative mechanisms, and therefore may be an important long-term factor in spaceflight. Short of conducting long-term experiments with rodents in space, analysis of the early cell cycle arrest signaling pathways in osteogenic bone cells after short-term spaceflight is the most practical current approach to predict the long-term degenerative effects of microgravity. To perform this analysis we focused on the activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis pathways such as those mediated by the tumor and growth suppressor, p53, and the cell cycle inhibitor, CDKN1a/p21. P53 levels are reported to increase in the muscle of hindlimb-unloaded animals [27], potentially leading to cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis. Furthermore, p53 knockout mice have preserved trabecular bone volume following hindlimb-unloading [28] and generally, osteopetrotic bone, suggesting  role for the p53-signaling pathway in the regulation of bone formation and degradation [29,30]. More remarkably, the CDKN1a/p21 Figure . Micro-Computed Tomography (mCT) Analysis of Spaceflown Ischium. The ischium of the pelvis, shown in orange (), was analyzed using mCT (720 slices = .89 mm). The anatomical markers used for mCT analysis were () caudal apex of obturator foramen, () dorsal-most point of the ventral ramus of ischium, and () the ischial tuberosity () (For full details on anatomical markers see [74]). The ischial cross-sectional geometry () was analyzed by length (), the width at the midpoint () and at / distance from the obturator foramen (); and the bend angle (). Flight samples () exhibited  more open cross-sectional geometry compared to the ground control (), indicating  possible reduction in the pull force applied to the bone. Ground control samples () also exhibited greater thickness (orange/red) then the flight samples (), indicating  reduction in overall bone thickness in spaceflight samples. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0061372.g001 Bone Loss and p21 Expression in Microgravity PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org  April 2013 | Volume  | Issue  | e61372\n\nknockout mouse has  viable phenotype with strong tissue regenerative abilities, such as limb re-growth, otherwise unheard of in adult mammals [31]. CDKN1a/p21 can be activated by environmental conditions such as oxidative stress and radiation, or be part of normal cell cycle arrest mechanisms during cell differentiation. This phenotype suggests CDKN1a/p21 up-regu- lation in microgravity could explain broad regenerative deficits in space. Recent studies have highlighted the potential role of osteocytes, terminally differentiated osteoblasts embedded within the miner- alized matrix, in the bone remodeling process, including in osteolysis of the lacunar surface for maintenance of calcium homeostasis [32,33]. Results from light and electron microscopy of rat bone in  22-day spaceflight experiment conducted in 1977 indicated the appearance of lacunae changed to   wide  morphology that could contribute to bone loss in space [34]. Recently, it was found that osteocytes acquired  more rounded shape after 91-days in microgravity during the Mice Drawer System experiment on ISS, albeit no statistical significance was obtained due to low , and the authors did not conclude that osteocytic degradation of the lacunae surface was occurring [35]. On the other hand, osteocytic osteolysis was shown to be present in lactating mice but not activated in animals that were hindlimb unloaded for  weeks [36], leaving the potential role and importance of osteocytic osteolysis during spaceflight an open question. To address the limited understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying bone degeneration in space following the initial osteoclastic activation, we focused on the processes related to osteoblastic and osteocytic activities. We hypothesized that decreases in bone formation during spaceflight may be mediated by an inability of cells in osteogenic lineages to proliferate and differentiate normally due to reduced mechanical stimuli in microgravity. Finally, we also hypothesized that reduced mechan- ostimulation of osteocytes in microgravity may signal the activation of osteocytic osteolysis of lacunar surfaces, with accompanying activation of matrix degradation pathways. Our spaceflight results presented here, suggest that the bone degener- ative effects of microgravity in skeletally mature mice go beyond rapid osteoclastic activation, affecting also cell cycle regulation in the osteogenic lineage, and inducing osteocytic osteolysis. Results Body Mass of Animals Pre- and Post-Flight All flight and ground control mice were observed to be in good condition by veterinary examination immediately post-landing. Noticeably, the posture of space-flown mouse tails after landing was vertical, indicating increased vestibular function in this group. The average weight loss of space-flown mice was . (29.%, SD = . ,  = .013) significantly lower than pre-flight values, consistent with tissue atrophy in microgravity, while synchronous ground control mice only lost an average of . (23.%, SD = . ,  = .096) of their body weight relative to the beginning of spaceflight. The difference in body weight loss averages for flight versus ground controls was not statistically significant ( = .143). Flight habitats showed utilization of resources on average of 10% less food, and 24% less water than synchronous ground controls. However, food and water utilization does not account for actual consumption by mice, because differences may occur in food bar and water losses due to crumbling and spillage in microgravity versus  . Spaceflight Causes Osteoclast and Osteocyte-Mediated Bone Loss in the Pelvic Region of Mice To determine if bone loss occurred in microgravity, we examined the bone structure and mineral density of the ischial region of the pelvis using micro-computed tomography (mCT). Specifically, we investigated the region from the caudal apex of the obturator foramen through to the ischial tuberosity (Fig. 1A) and found that spaceflight resulted in  .23% decrease ( = .005) in bone volume fraction (BV/TV) and 11.91% decrease ( = .002) in overall bone thickness (Th) (Table ). No difference was observed in bone mineral density and total bone volumes measured (TV and BV) (Table ). However, comparison of ischial structural thickness of spaceflight versus ground control animals revealed that bone from flight animals not only had  reduced overall thickness (Fig. 1F and ), but also showed changes in ischial shape localized to the surface of the descending ramus of ischium along the posterior margin of the obturator foramen (Fig. 1B). Analysis of cross-sectional slices revealed that the flight samples had similar widths at two measured points (/ ratio of .09, Fig. 1D, Table ), and  mean bend angle of 167u (deviating 13u from linear, or less bent), compared to  width ratio of .39 in ground control samples and  bend angle of 160u (deviating 20u from linear, or more bent) (Fig. 1C, Table ), indicating that ischial geometry changes in response to spaceflight.",

Furthermore, when we analyzed the thickness distribution of ischial cross- sectional slices, we found that flight animals exhibited  higher percentage of slices in the .007 .128 mm range and  lower percentage of slices in the .129 .291 mm range compared to ground controls (Fig. 1E). The shift in thickness distribution to the left in flight animals indicates an overall decrease in cross-sectional thickness throughout the ischium. In order to study nanoscale aspects of bone loss following spaceflight, we used transmission -ray microscopy to perform 40 nm resolution nano-computed tomography (nanoCT). No difference was found in bulk density of cortical bone between the flight and ground controls (Fig. 2G), however, flight samples exhibited an enlargement in lacunae of 17% in cross sectional area ( = .022) and  14% increase in lacunae perimeter ( = .008) when compared to ground controls (Fig. 2C , ). In addition, lacunar circularity decreased in spaceflight by % ( = .037) indicating an increase in irregularly-shaped or elongated lacunae (Fig. 2A , ). We also measured canalicular diameters in  15 mm perilacunar region and found an increase of % in spaceflight samples relative to ground controls ( = .037, Fig. 2F), indicating that the observed lacunar enlargement may extend throughout these networks. To characterize osteoclast bone resorbing activity during spaceflight, we used TRAP staining on sections of the proximal femur. We found  197% increase in osteoclast numbers in the bone surface of the trabecular region below the femoral head growth plate of flight samples (.99 Oc/mm) compared to ground controls (.36 Oc/mm) ( = .001, Fig. 3A ). The bone surface covered by osteoclasts also increased by 154% in microgravity (25.% in spaceflight versus .99% in ground controls,  = .004 Fig. 3D). Results for spaceflight induction of all TRAP-positive osteoclasts, independent of number of nuclei, were comparable. Interestingly, we also found an increase in the ratio of TRAP- positive osteocytes to total osteocytes in the femoral shaft of flight samples compared to ground controls (34.43% and 20.94% respectively,  = .004, Fig. 3D ). To determine if osteocyte survival was altered by microgravity we measured the number of empty lacunae in cortical bone from the proximal femur and found no differences between ground and flight samples (10.% and 10.% empty lacunae respectively,  = .680, Fig. 3H).

These results indicate roles for both osteoclastic and osteocytic bone degradation in microgravity. Spaceflight Induces MMP-Mediated Extracellular Matrix Remodeling in Bone Among bone extracellular matrix related genes analyzed using RT-qPCR arrays we found small but statistically significant alterations in mRNA levels of collagens, and laminin subunits, but not in fibronectin (Fig. 4A, Table ). Among matrix metallopro- teinases, MMP , , and 10 showed significant up-regulation in flight samples compared to ground controls (12.94, .98, and 16.85 fold respectively, ,.05), while MMP inhibitors, TIMP , , and , displayed no statistically significant change in gene expression levels (Table ). Several cell adhesion molecules; specifically Cdh4, Cdh11, and Vcam1 were found to be up- regulated (.46, .53, and .57 fold respectively, ,.05), while Itgal and Icam1 were found to be down-regulated (.45 and .52 fold respectively, ,.05) (Fig. 4A, Table ). These results indicate that spaceflight promotes bone extracellular matrix degradation, while overall increase in expression of collagen, Tuft1, Sparc, and Phex (Table ), may be related to increased bone mineralization following degradation. To determine the cellular location of MMP10 we conducted immunohistochemical analysis on paraffin embedded sections of the proximal femur. Results showed MMP10-positive staining in osteoblasts along the periosteal surface of the proximal femur in both flight and ground controls. However, osteocytes embedded in the bone matrix exhibited strong MMP10-positive staining in flight samples (Fig. 4C) but not in ground (Fig. 4B). Spaceflight Suppresses Pro-Osteogenic Growth and Proliferation Gene Expression in Bone To further study the effects of spaceflight in reducing bone formation, we investigated the expression of genes involved in promoting the cellular growth, proliferation, and differentiation of the osteoprogenitor lineage. number of growth factors studied showed altered gene expression levels by qPCR, including Bmp-, Tgf-b2, Gdf10, and Csf3 (21.99, 21.59, 21.43, .72 fold, ,.05) (Fig. 5A, Table ). Furthermore, we found several genes associated with cell growth and differentiation that were altered, including Egr1, Myod1, and Fgf3 which were down-regulated (22.30, 21.61, and 21. fold respectively, ,.05), while Twist1 and Fgf1 were up-regulated (.80 and .53 fold respectively, ,.01) (Fig. 5A, Table ). Results also indicate the alteration in gene expression of two transcription factors, Vitamin  receptor (Vdr) and Sox9, which exhibited  .80 fold up-regulation and .28 fold down-regulation respectively (Fig. 5A, Table ). Spaceflight Induces CDKN1a/p21 but Not Trp53/p53 Expression in Bone In addition to the effects we observed on osteogenesis promoting gene expression, we hypothesized that bone loss in space may also be mediated by alterations in intracellular signaling cascades resulting in activation of the p53/p21 signaling pathways that promote cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Analysis of spaceflight samples by qPCR showed that mRNA expression levels of tumor suppressor gene p53 (Trp/p53) were down-regulated .54 fold while CDKN1a/p21 exhibited  .31 fold up-regulation in response to exposure to spaceflight (,.01) (Fig. 6G). The expression of Mdm2,  negative regulator of p53, was also increased, indicating suppression of the p53 apoptotic pathway (Fig. 6G, Table ). Several genes associated with cell cycle regulation were also altered in flight samples including cell cycle arrest related genes Fbxo4, Fbxo31, Btg2, and Cdkn2b (.87, .74, 21.50, and .41 fold respectively, ,.05), and cell cycle related genes cyclin B2, Cdc25c, Mul1, Gdf10, and Csf3 (.63, .55, .64, 21.43 and .72 fold respectively, ,.05) (Fig. 6G, Table ). Several genes related to the induction of apoptosis were also altered including, Cradd, Dapk1, Fbxo3, which were up-regulated in flight samples (.62, .53, and .48 fold respectively, ,.01) (Fig. 6G). Hecw2, which acts to stabilize p73, was also up- regulated in flight samples (.25, ,.01), as was p73, albeit not statistically significantly (.02 fold,  = .20) (Table ). In order to determine the specific cellular localization of the p21 and p53 proteins, we conducted immunohistochemical analysis on sections of the right proximal femur of both flight animals and synchronous ground controls. Using  rabbit anti-mouse p21 polyclonal antibody, we found that osteoblasts along the periosteal surface of the proximal femur were p21-positive in flight samples Table .

Muscle fibers surrounding the femur contained strongly positive p21 staining nuclei in spaceflight but not ground control samples (Fig. 6C ). When we investigated the expression of p53 in proximal sections of the femur using  p53 polyclonal antibody, no significant staining was found in most sections from both flight and ground controls , indicating that p53 was not strongly expressed. Spaceflight Alters Gene Expression That Can Interfere with Survival and Mitogenic Signal Transduction As cell signaling promoting cell survival via phosphoinositide - kinase (Pi3K)/protein kinase  (Akt) and cell proliferation via Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAP kinase) can both be activated in response to mechano-transduction, and as they can modulate p53 and p21 signaling, we investigated key genes of interest in these pathways with qPCR. MAP kinases, such as MAPK10, MAPK11, and MAPK12 (.81, 21.54, and 21.43 fold respectively, ,.01), MAP  kinases, such as Moloney sarcoma oncogene, Mos (24.18 fold, ,.01), and cell growth molecules including Egr1 (22.30 fold, ,.01) showed altered expression in spaceflight (Fig. , Table ). Several molecules associated with Ras signaling displayed alterations, including Nf1 (21.45 fold, ,.05) and Sos1 (22.51 fold, ,.01); however, only small changes in KRas expression was found (21.24 fold, ,.05) (Fig. 5B, Table ). No statistically significant alterations in Pi3K subunits were noted except  small change in the alpha polypeptide of the catalytic subunit of Pi3K (21.39 fold, ,.01) (Table ). Additionally, no statistically significant alterations in Akt1 or  Figure . Nano-Computed Tomography Analysis of Lacunar Enlargement Following Spaceflight.

Analysis of NFkB transcriptional target genes involved in cell adhesion, regulation of apoptosis and growth factors and ligands including Traf1, BMP4, Egr1, p53, and MMP3 (repressor) were found to be down-regulated, indicating inhibition of this pathway after exposure to spaceflight (Fig. 5B, Table ). Discussion In this study, we investigated cellular and molecular gene expression mechanisms underlying bone degeneration in space, with an emphasis on the processes related to osteoblastic and osteocytic activities in the pelvic girdle and proximal femur of 16- week-old C57BL/6J female mice. Although data in this field is not extensive, exposure to microgravity is known to alter bone homeostasis, causing primarily increased osteoclast-mediated bone resorption, and possibly inhibition of bone formation. Here we sought to test the hypothesis that like osteoclastic activity, osteogenic cell cycle arrest and increased osteocytic osteolysis, may also contribute to bone loss in space. We first characterized standard bone mineral and structural parameters following spaceflight to establish the magnitude of bone loss in our microgravity model system. Our results confirm the ischium portion of the pelvis (Fig. 1A) lost .% ( = .005) bone volume fraction and 11.% ( = .002) in bone thickness (Table ) with an accompanying reduction in trabecular bridges between ischial surfaces (Fig. 1E ). In addition, bone loss was accompanied by large increases in osteoclast numbers (197%) and osteoclast-covered trabecular bone surfaces measured in the femoral head (154%) (Fig. 3A ). This observed initial (15-day) rate of bone loss, translated to approximately 12% 24% loss per month, is high compared to established long-term astronaut bone loss values of  % per month. The high-levels of osteoclastic activity we observed may, however, subside after the initial transition to microgravity. On earth at  , patients with tetraplegia show an initial phase of pronounced cancellous bone loss, up to 30%, that subsides one-year post onset of paralysis [37]. Bed rest also results in increased osteoclast activity within 24  of immobilization [38], and 120  bed rest causes increased bone resorption surfaces in the pelvis by osteoclasts [39]. After this initial phase of osteoclastic resorption in patients, cortical bone loss continues, although at  reduced rate that is medically more manageable. If osteoclastic activity returns to normal after  period of transition after unloading, continued bone loss may correspond to reduced osteogenic activity and osteocytic osteolysis. Finally, the geometry of the ischium in flight samples is also altered with  wider marrow cavity conformation than ground controls (Fig. 1B  , Table ). Specifically, bone geometry near the ischial tuberosity, which provides  hindlimb muscle attachment surface, appears most altered. Among the muscles attaching to the ischium, the quadratus femoris plays an important  antigravity  role in Figure . TRAP Staining of Osteoclast and Osteocyte-Mediated Bone Resorption Following Spaceflight. Panel  displays  representative cancellous region near the femoral head growth plate (406) from ground control mice, which is mostly free of TRAP-positive osteoclasts, whilst  displays  similar region from flight animals with numerous TRAP-positive osteoclasts. Analysis of osteoclastic activity in the trabecular region below the femoral head of the femur showed an increase in osteoclast numbers in the bone surface of the growth plate of flight samples compared to ground controls (.99 Oc/mm and .36 Oc/mm respectively) (). The bone surface covered by osteoclasts was also increased in flight animals compared to ground controls (25.40% and .99% respectively, ). The number of TRAP-positive osteocytes in cortical bone from the femoral shaft proximal to the femoral head was increased in response to spaceflight () compared to ground controls () (34.43% and 20.94% respectively, ). However, we found no differences in the number of empty lacunae in cortical bone between flight and ground controls (10.% and 10.% empty lacunae respectively, ). * indicates ,.05, # indicates ,.01. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0061372.g003 Bone Loss and p21 Expression in Microgravity PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org  April 2013 | Volume  | Issue  | e61372\n\nTable . mRNA Gene Expression Levels Altered Following Spaceflight.

Having established that microgravity induces high-levels of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in our model system, we then sought to determine if osteocytic osteolysis was also activated. Osteocytes, are the most abundant cell type in bone and are thought to play  role in spaceflight-induced bone loss [41,42,43]. Lacunar enlargement was previously reported in  22-day spaceflight in the 1970s with juvenile rats but was not conclusively demonstrated [34]. However, mice subjected to hindlimb unload- ing do not show increased lacunar area, suggesting that osteocytic osteolysis does not play  role in bone loss due to hindlimb unloading at   [36]. Using nanoCT (Fig. ), we found no bone density differences in non-lacunar regions between flight and ground samples. However, flight samples did exhibit lacunar enlargement relative to ground controls, as well as decreased circularity, and increased canalicular diameter (Fig. 2C ). These results suggest an increase in osteocytic degradation of lacunar surfaces and highlight  possible difference in the ground-based model for mechanical hindlimb unloading at   versus unloading in microgravity. Furthermore, the number of TRAP-positive osteocytes in flight samples was increased compared to ground controls, with no apparent differences in cell death or lacunar emptying (Fig. 3E ). Although TRAP is an iron containing enzyme known to be  specific and highly sensitive marker of bone resorption by osteoclasts, Nakano et al (2004) also showed TRAP activity in osteocytes [44]. TRAP-active osteocytes in the trabecular and cortical bone may therefore contribute to bone resorption in lacunae [44]. Furthermore, Qing et al (2012) found that gene expression analysis of osteocyte-enriched bone from lactating mice exhibited increased expression of TRAP, as well as several other osteoclast specific genes such as cathepsin , carbonic anhydrase  and , and MMP13 [36]. TRAP may also be needed for normal bone mineral remodeling and endochondral ossification, as mice lacking TRAP exhibit an osteopetrotic Table . Cont.

It is currently debated whether osteocytes contribute to bone remodeling and loss during spaceflight (for full review see [33]), however, our results support  role for microgravity-induced osteocytic osteolysis. To further investigate osteocyte-mediated molecular mecha- nisms associated with bone loss in space, we analyzed gene expression changes relevant to bone extracellular matrix in marrow-free bone tissue containing predominantly osteocytes but also osteoblasts. We found increases in mRNA levels for several collagen molecules and laminin subunits, suggesting increased matrix remodeling, and significant up-regulation of mRNA for matrix metalloproteinases , , and 10 in flight samples compared to ground controls, while MMP inhibitors showed no statistically significant alterations in expression (Fig. , Table ). Remarkably we also found that osteocytes embedded within the cortical bone of the proximal femur were strongly MMP10 positive in flight samples but not in ground controls, indicating that the up- regulation of MMP10 transcripts in flight samples may originate in osteocytes. ECM proteinases play  critical role in normal pericellular matrix remodeling following environmental stimuli, such as mechanical load, and matrix calcium regulation in normal physiological states as well as in many disease states, such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis [46,47,48]. Previous studies have shown that osteoclasts secrete MMP1 and  during bone remodeling [49].",

ECM proteinases play  critical role in normal pericellular matrix remodeling following environmental stimuli, such as mechanical load, and matrix calcium regulation in normal physiological states as well as in many disease states, such as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis [46,47,48]. Previous studies have shown that osteoclasts secrete MMP1 and  during bone remodeling [49]. Furthermore, stromelysins (MMP3 and 10) retain significant activity in the acidic environment found in osteoclast resorptive pits and are secreted by osteoclasts in the sub- osteoclastic resorptive zone [49]. The number of dendritic processes from an osteocyte also increases with age, indicating that osteocytes embedded within the mineralized matrix may have the ability to generate new processes [50,51]. In total, this gene and protein expression data, together with the ability of osteocytes to express the osteoclast marker TRAP and MMP10, support  role for osteocytic osteolysis in microgravity. In addition to  role for osteocytic osteolysis, we also hypothesized that bone loss in space may be mediated by intracellular signaling cascades that result in activation of p53 and p21 during osteogenesis. Tumor suppressor protein 53 (p53) is  growth suppressor and  transcriptional regulator which modulates the expression of  wide range of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and differentiation [52] and p53 activation generally results in apoptosis. Mice null for p53 exhibit extensive blood tumors and an osteopetrotic bone phenotype, indicating  role for the p53 signaling pathway in the regulation of bone formation and degradation [29,30]. Previous studies have also demonstrated that p53 levels are increased in the muscle of animals exposed to spaceflight [27] and that p53 knockout mice have preserved trabecular bone volume following hindlimb unloading [28]. In contrast to these findings we determined that Figure . Spaceflight Causes Up-Regulation of Matrix Degra- dation Molecules.

Immunohistochemical analysis localized this overexpression of p21 to osteoblasts along the periosteal surface of the proximal femur (, ground control, , flight). Interestingly, we also observed p21-positive nuclei in cross-sections and longitudinal sections of muscle fibers adjacent to the femur ( , ground control,  , flight). *indicates ,.05, # indicates ,.01. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0061372.g006 Bone Loss and p21 Expression in Microgravity PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 10 April 2013 | Volume  | Issue  | e61372\n\nmRNA expression levels of p53 in marrow free bone tissue was down-regulated and immunohistochemical analysis showed no nuclear or cytoplasmic accumulation of p53. Furthermore, examination of osteocyte nuclei in lacunae from cortical bone of the femur also revealed no differences in the number of empty lacunae, or nuclei with pyknotic morphology in spaceflight versus ground control animals. Previous research, however, has found that hindlimb unloading can result in osteocyte apoptosis and bone loss in the lumbar region of the spine [41]. Research into spaceflight versus   simulations of spaceflight has, however, found differences in bone loss mechanisms including in trabecular bone loss, cancellous mineralization, and bone resorption rates [53]. Our data, including decreased message levels of p53, lack of protein accumulation of p53, and no alterations in osteocytic cell death, suggests that in contrast to hindlimb unloading, osteocyte apoptosis is mostly absent in short-term spaceflight. Previous studies have shown that periosteal bone formation is inhibited [25] and osteoblast populations are decreased [24] in response to spaceflight, however, the molecular mechanisms causing this arrest of bone formation are not yet known. In contrast to p53, which we found to be down-regulated, expression of CDKN1a/p21,  cell cycle arrest mediator immediately downstream of p53, and other stress response pathways were up-regulated during spaceflight (Fig. , Table ), which may cause an inhibition of osteogenesis and bone formation. Immunohisto- chemical analysis showed that p21 in flight samples was strongly localized to osteoblast nuclei on the periosteal surface of the femur and near the femoral head. In addition, spaceflight animals showed increased nuclear p21 staining in muscle fibers attached to the femur. MRL mice, which regenerate cartilage, skin, hair follicles, and myocardium with high fidelity and without scarring [54], also lack p21 expression, providing evidence that p21 could play  role in inhibiting tissue regeneration. In addition, CDKN1a/p21 knockout mice also have  regenerative phenotype similar to MRL mice, with normal development, early entry into  phase of the cell cycle, enhanced proliferation, and sensitivity to UV-induced apoptosis [31]. Elevated CDKN1a/p21 levels in spaceflight may therefore explain the observed reduction in osteogenesis and bone growth. The expression of CDKN1a/p21 may also occur in tissues, possibly resulting in  systemic cell cycle and tissue regenerative response. In addition to bone, our gene expression results also show accumulation of p21 in muscle (Fig. ) and heart tissue (. Kumar, ... Almeida, and .. Globus, unpublished results). One possible mechanism for systemic expression of CDKN1a/p21 in the mouse may be oxidative stress induced by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Elevated levels of ROS can result in increased lipid peroxidation and decreased levels of antioxidants, which have been reported both in spaceflight and hindlimb-unloading studies [55,56,57,58]. Although the effect of CDKN1a/p21 accumulation in muscle and cardiomyocytes is not addressed in this study, it is possible that  systemic activation of CDKN1a/p21 by ROS could be occurring and might interfere with generalized tissue proliferation, repair and regeneration. Various other genes associated with cell cycle regulation were altered in response to spaceflight, including cell cycle arrest molecules and cell cycle regulation molecules (Table ). Such molecules included up-regulation of Fbxo4 and Fbxo31 that have been shown to stimulate the ubiquitination of Ccnd1 [59,60,61]. Ccnd1 promotes the transition from G1 to  phase of the cell cycle and is also considered  mediator of signaling from extracellular stimuli to the cell cycle machinery. Furthermore, several of the up- regulated molecules, specifically, Ube2e3 and Mul1, are thought to be involved in cell growth arrest due to mitochondrial fragmentation. Although we have found no cellular evidence of increased apoptosis, several apoptosis-related genes were also up- regulated in flight samples including Cradd, Dapk1, Fbxo31, Hecw2 and MAPK10 (Table ). The expression of these genes without increased cellular indications of apoptosis could be related to the survival-promoting function of p21 when the cell cycle is arrested. In order to determine the influence of spaceflight on osteogenic signaling pathways, we conducted RT-qPCR analysis of growth factor transcripts for genes involved in osteogenesis, bone mineralization, and their regulatory transcription factors. Altered growth factor binding in particular, can have significant impacts on intracellular signaling cascades and gene expression. We found message expression reductions in TGF-b2; FGF1 and ; BMP4; Egr1; and Csf3 (Fig. , Table ). Tgf- is produced by osteoblasts and deposited in bone matrix during bone formation, and released by osteoclasts during bone resorption [62]. Additionally, Tgf- induces proliferation and differentiation in osteoblasts while inhibiting osteoclast precursor differentiation and bone resorption [63,64]. Decreased levels of Tgf- in the hindlimb of flight samples compared to ground controls has previously been reported. Tgf- has also been suggested to play  critical role in the mechanosen- sing ability of bone and bone cells by serving as an intracellular messenger between strain responsive cells and other bone cells [65]. Decreased levels of Tgf- in the periosteum but not in the cancellous compartment of the hindlimb, correlated with decreas- es in periosteal bone formation and mineral deposition rates, are suggestive of  role for Tgf- in mechanical-loading-induced bone formation. We also found decreases in the expression levels of Bmp4 message (Table ), which is one of the most potent inducers of bone formation through stimulation of osteoblast differentiation. It has recently been shown that Bmp4-induced cell cycle arrest during osteoblast differentiation is dependent on the induction of p21 and p27 expression [66]. Several additional genes associated with cell growth and differentiation including Myod1, Twist1, and Egr1 were also altered in spaceflight (Fig. 5A, Table ). Myod1 is known for its function in muscle cells where it causes increased differentiation through activation of p21 [67]. Myod1, however, is also broadly expressed in other tissues and down-regulation of Myod1 message is suggestive of decreased p21-mediated cell differentiation. In agreement with this, Twist , known to be involved in differentiation by inhibiting DNA binding by Myod1 and transactivation by Mef2, was up-regulated. Decreased Myod1 expression suggests  decrease in CDKN1a/p21 levels associated with cell differentiation, and leads us to hypothesize that the CDKN1a/p21 elevation we observe in spaceflight is independent of differentiation, and possibly induced by the oxidative stress related to reduced mechanical load in microgravity. Egr1 has been shown to be regulated by -Fos [68], however, Egr1 activation has also been shown to occur independently of -Fos through activation of the Erk / pathway in response to shear stress. Although the exact mechanism regulating Egr1 activity is not examined here, down-regulation of this molecule has important implications for cell growth and differentiation due to its potential role in the regulation of over 30 genes. Furthermore, decreased levels of Egr1 leads to decreased formation of the Egr1/Sp1 complex resulting in increased levels of free Sp1 available for binding to the -CSF promoter, increased -CSF expression, and consequently, more osteoclast formation [69]. The observed decreases in TGF- message could also contribute to decreased Egr- expression. Vitamin  receptor and Sox9, two transcription factors involved in osteogenesis, were also differentially expressed in spaceflight.

Activation of Sox9 by p38-MAP kinase signaling results in chondrocyte growth and differentiation while depression of Sox9 transcription results in cartilage degeneration and osteo-arthritis [55,73]. Additionally, Sox9 is important for extracellular matrix production [73]. P38-MAP kinase down- regulation and loss of Sox9 transcriptional activation may therefore have important implications for cartilage health and regeneration, and matrix production in spaceflight. Rps6kb1,  down-stream effector of the Pi3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, was also down-regulated in spaceflight (Table ), and is involved in cell proliferation through the activation of protein synthesis by Eif4e and inhibition of apoptosis through phosphorylation of BAD (for full review see [56]). Conclusions In total, our findings demonstrate the pelvic-femoral musculo- skeletal complex as  highly load and gravity sensitive structure that can serve as  valuable model to study muscle and bone degeneration in space. Additionally, we demonstrate that bone responses to spaceflight are complex and involve osteoclastic, osteoblastic, and osteocytic degenerative responses. Finally, our findings on CDKN1a/p21 up-regulation in microgravity have the potential to become  major concern for tissue regenerative health in long-duration spaceflight. Future studies should address the specific molecular regulatory mechanisms of CDKN1a/p21 involvement in tissue degeneration during long-term spaceflight and the possibility of systemic activation of this strong molecular inhibitor of regenerative adult stem cell proliferation. Methods Ethics Statement All experimental animal procedures for STS-131 were ap- proved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center under protocol NAS-10-002-Y1, and conformed to the .. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. Animals Female, 16-week-old C57BL/6J mice ( = ) were subjected to 15-days of spaceflight on board the space shuttle Discovery during the STS-131 mission, and as part of the NASA Biospecimen Sharing Program for the spaceflight experiment  Mouse Antigen- Specific CD4+  Cell Priming and Memory Response during Spaceflight . Animals used in this study were not subjected to experimental procedures during spaceflight. Animals were housed in the NASA Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) habitats for the duration of the flight and were exposed to normal day/night cycles. The NASA AEM units are composed of  stainless steel grid cage, fan blowers,  layered filter system, interior lamps, food bars and  water box. They are self-contained habitats that provide up to  mice with constant access to food and water while also providing  waste management system that isolates the animals from their waste and food crumbs. The AEMs were housed within  standard middeck locker on board the space shuttle. Animals were not acclimated to habitats prior to flight, but were provided with both the food bars and water bottles used in flight for at least  weeks prior to launch. Synchronous ground controls were also conducted using identical AEM modules. Spaceflight and synchronous ground control animals were weighed pre- and post-flight and were subjected to veterinary examination before euthanasia. Food and water consumption of each group was measured upon recovery and averaged per mouse per day. Animals were euthanized approximately   after landing using isoflurane anesthesia followed by thoracotomy. Upon recovery, the pelvis and femur were dissected and the soft tissue was removed from the bones. The bone marrow was flushed from both left and right ilium and proximal femora and used for other experimental procedures not described in this paper. Care was taken to avoid disturbing the cancellous bone and bone marrow in both femoral heads during aspiration, to allow for TRAP and immunohistochemical analysis of this region. Both ilia were placed in  ml RNAlater at 4uC for 24  to enable it to penetrate the bone. Vials were then transferred to 280uC and shipped on dry ice to NASA Ames Research Center for isolation of RNA and gene expression analysis. The pelvic ischium and proximal femur were fixed in % paraformaldehyde for 24  at 4uC, washed twice with PBS, and stored in PBS at 4uC. The pelvic ischium was used for microcomputed tomography (mCT) and nano-computed tomography (nCT), while the proximal femur was used for TRAP staining and immunohistochemical analysis of proteins of interest as described below. Micro-Computed Tomography (mCT) Micro-computed tomography (mCT) was used to image and quantify bone morphometry of the ischium region in the right coxa (SkyScan 1174 microCT scanner, Kontich, Belgium). Of the original  samples in each group, both flight and ground control had one sample that was fractured during the dissection rendering it unsuitable for the mCT analysis ( = ). Scanning. Each ischium with soft tissue still intact, previously fixed in % paraformaldehyde and stored in PBS, was mounted vertically into  low--ray density Styrofoam holder, wrapped with Press--Seal film to prevent drying, and scanned in air. Images were acquired at 50 kV and 800 mA with . mm aluminum -ray detector filter,  pixel resolution of .77 mm, voxel volume of 310.29 mm3, an exposure time of . per frame with  averaging frames,  rotation step of .5u, and  rotational angle of 180u. Reconstruction. Raw image data were reconstructed into  stack of 2D cross-sectional slices using NRecon volumetric reconstruction software (Skyscan v1...). Reconstruction was carried out with  beam hardening correction of 30%,  ring artefact correction of , and  dynamic contrast range of  to .10. Analysis of bone structure and mineral density. For analysis,  selected region of .89 mm (720 slices), starting from  slices proximal to caudal apex of the obturator foramen through ischial tuberosity (Fig. 1A), was analyzed using CTan software (Skyscan v1.10..). global binarization threshold of 65/255 was applied to the reconstructed images. As the mouse ischium is  thin bone with similarly sized bridge-like trabeculae connecting two opposing cortical sheets, we were unable to analyse cortical and trabecular bone regions separately. Instead we contoured along  perimeter of the cortical bone using   shrink-wrap  custom plug- in of CTan software and analyzed them together. The following indices for mineralized tissue were investigated: total volume of region of interest (TV), bone volume of region of interest (BV), bone volume fraction (BV/TV), average thickness (Th), and mean Bone Loss and p21 Expression in Microgravity PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 12 April 2013 | Volume  | Issue  | e61372\n\nlinear attenuation coefficient. In addition to calculated indices, 3D analysis included the generation of color-coded image maps of ischial structure thickness. These images were loaded into CTvox 3D visualization program (Skyscan v1..or479) for  qualitative comparison of bone thickness between flight and ground control groups. To gain some insight on whether the shape of the ischium had changed with the flight environment, we examined  single cross-sectional slice, cut at the dorsal-most point of the descending ischial ramus, and measured the bend angle, the length, and the width at two points, half and one-third of the way from the proximal end (Fig. 1D), using CTan measurement tools. two- tailed student  -test (GraphPad PRISM) was carried out to compare the means, with -value ,.05 considered to be statistically significant. Nano-Computed Tomography (NanoCT) Following spaceflight, we performed high-resolution measure- ments of bone density and lacunar nanostructure using the hard -ray Transmission Microscopy (TXM) facility at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Light Source (SSRL). Analysis was performed on similarly oriented transverse sections of cortical bone from mouse ischia near the dorsal-most point of the descending ischial ramus. Sample preparation. Ischia from seven ground control and eight spaceflight mice were fixed in % paraformaldehyde and stored in PBS, prior to cutting 30 mm thick cortical bone sections using single-use steel histology blades. Scanning. -ray attenuation images were acquired at . keV energy with 40 nm resolution. Triplicate 0u angle images of each sample for osteocyte lacunar and canalicular analysis were obtained with an exposure of   and  beam intensity of . Images at 90u, were exposed for   with  beam intensity of , and used to measure section thickness. Measurement of bone mineral density. For calibration of mineral density to an -ray attenuation curve, we used chlorapatite crystals standards and methods previously described [22]. Briefly, to account for beam intensity variations, for each synchrotron experimental run we imaged known size and mineral density chlorapatite crystal standards and plotted log -ray attenuation relative to thicknesses in the  to 100  size calibration range. Bone density was then calculated from measured 0u bone attenuation values and 90u section thickness values, relative to the standard -ray attenuation curve. Lacunar morphometry. For quantification of lacunar area, circularity, and perimeter, we used Image  software to trace lacunae in 0u angle images and measured area, circularity, and perimeter in the outlined regions of interest. To measure changes in the dimensions of canaliculi following spaceflight, we selected  15 mm region of interest extending into the bone from the lacunar wall surface, and measured canalicular diameters. Unpaired -test analysis was carried out to compare the means, with -value ,.05 considered to be statistically significant. Tartrate Resistant Acid Phosphatase (TRAP) Staining The right proximal femur was used for tartrate resistance acid phosphatase staining. Bone marrow was gently aspirated from the shaft region of the femur so as not to disturb cancellous bone and bone marrow in the femoral head. Flushed bone was then demineralized using 20% EDTA for 21 days, with solution changes every three days. Decalcified bones were dehydrated in  graded ethanol series and embedded in paraffin in preparation for immunohistochemical analysis. Longitudinal sections of  mm thickness were prepared and immediately before analysis, sections were deparaffinized in 100% xylene, and rehydrated in 100% EtOH, 95% EtOH, 75% EtOH and DI H2O consecutively. TRAP staining was then conducted on these sections ( =  sections per animal,  =  mice). The sections were stained for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) using an Acid Phosphatase Leukocyte Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Catalog #387A- 1KT) according to the manufacturer protocol. Images were acquired immediately after staining at magnifications of 206 and 406using  SPOT RT slider cooled CCD camera attached to an Olympus BX51 microscope. All images were taken at the same balance, gain, and brightness. To quantify osteoclast numbers and osteoclast contact with bone surfaces we imaged the central cancellous bone region in the proximal femur just below the growth plate. Criteria for inclusion of osteoclasts in cell counts included TRAP-positive staining, at least  nuclei, and  contact surface with cancellous bone of at least 10 mm. Using Image , we measured the total number of osteoclasts that met the inclusion criteria, length of cancellous bone surface, and length osteoclast contact surface with cancellous bone. The following indices for mineralized tissue were investigated: total number of osteoclasts per mm of bone surface (.Oc./BS), and percentage of osteoclast- covered surface (Oc../BS). To analyze osteocytes, Image  was used to perform  cell count of TRAP-positive osteocytes and total number of osteocytes in the cortical bone immediately distal to the growth plate of the femur. All statistical analyses were performed using an unpaired -test to determine the significant differences between ground control and spaceflight samples. RNA Isolation and RT-qPCR Analysis Total RNA was isolated from both RNAlater-fixed pelvic ilia (flushed of bone marrow) from spaceflight and ground control animals using the TRIzol method (Invitrogen). Briefly, ilia were homogenized with  hand held homogenizer in  ml of TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Catalog #15596-026) for 30 60 .",

Homog- enized samples were incubated in TRIzol for an additional  min, 200 ml of chloroform was added and samples were incubated for  further  min. Samples were centrifuged at 12,000  for 15 min at 4uC. The aqueous phase containing RNA was placed into  new tube and RNA was precipitated with 600 ml of isopropanol for 10 min. Samples were centrifuged again at 12,000  for 10 min at 4uC and the supernatant was discarded. RNA was washed with  ml 75% EtOH, centrifuged at ,500  for  min at 4uC, the pellet was air dried and re-dissolved in 30 ml RNase-free water. Samples were then purified using RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Catalog #74104) with genomic DNA elimination step according to the manufacturers protocol. RNA concentration was measured using spectrophotometry (Nanodrop, ThermoFisher) and quality was examined with agarose gel electrophoresis. Gene expression was analyzed using Qiagen Pathway-Focused Mouse qPCR Arrays. We examined genes involved in osteogenesis, extracellular matrix, ubiquitination, and the p53, Pi3K, NFkB, and MAP Kinase, signaling pathways in bone tissue. Each array consisted of primer sets for 84 pathway-focused genes of interest, five reference genes (Gusb, Hprt1, Hsp90ab1, Gapdh, and Actb), one genomic DNA contamination control, three positive PCR controls and three positive reverse transcription controls on  96 well plate. One mg of total RNA per sample ( = ) was reverse transcribed to cDNA using RT2 First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (SABios- ciences, Catalog #330401) according to the manufacturer  protocol. Briefly, genomic DNA elimination buffer was added to the sample and incubated at 42uC for  min. Reverse transcription cocktail containing primers, external controls and RT enzyme mix was then added to the samples and samples were incubated at 42uC for 15 min and the reaction was stopped by incubation at 95uC for  min. The cDNA was mixed with RT2 SYBR Green/ Bone Loss and p21 Expression in Microgravity PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 13 April 2013 | Volume  | Issue  | e61372\n\nRox qPCR master mix and equal volumes (25 ml) were added to PCR plates. Plates were sealed with optical thin-walled -cap strips (Qiagen, Catalog #1065667) and qPCR of sample arrays was performed using an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real Time PCR instrument. Real-time PCR conditions were as follows: one cycle 95uC for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95uC for 15  and 60uC for  min, followed by one cycle of 95uC for 15 , 60uC for  min, 95uC for 15  and 60uC for 15 . Gene expression levels from all arrays were analyzed for alterations in expression levels as compared to ground controls ( = , ,.05) using  PCR Array Data Analysis Template (v3., SABiosciences). Data analysis was based on the DDCt method and gene expression levels were normalized to four reference genes (Gusb, Hprt1, Gapdh, and Actb). Immunohistochemical and Immunocytochemical Analysis Sections of the right-proximal femur prepared as described above for TRAP Staining were also used for immunohistochem- ical and immunocytochemical analysis. The following primary polyclonal antibodies were used in the immunohistocehmical analysis: anti-p21 (:50 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti- p53 (:50 dilution, Santa-Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Matrix Metallopeptidase 10 (:20 dilution, Novus Biologicals) and anti- Mdm2 (:25 dilution, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Peroxidase conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG was used as the secondary antibody (:5000 dilution, Jackson Immunoresearch). Briefly, sections were immersed in sodium citrate buffer for 10 min at 95uC, washed in DI water and immersed in PBS containing .% Triton -100, pH . (265 min). Sections were then blocked in 10% normal blocking serum (Donkey serum in PBS-) for  period of   in  moist chamber at room temperature. Primary antibody incubation was conducted in  moist chamber at 4uC overnight. Sections were washed in PBS- and incubated with peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody in  moist chamber at room temperature for   and then rinsed with PBS- and incubated in peroxidase substrate for 12 30 min until staining was complete. Sections were washed in DI water and dehydrated in 75%, 95% and 100% EtOH followed by 100% xylene for  min at each stage. Sections were mounted in mounting medium and visualized using an Olympus BX51 light microscope. For osteocyte nuclear localization, we used Hoechst 33342 staining (500 ng/ml in DI water for 10 min at room temperature, Invitrogen, Catalog #H1399) on deparaffinized sections of the right-proximal femur prepared as described above. Lacunae with and without Hoechst stained nuclei, and nuclear pyknotic morphology were used to quantify osteocyte apoptosis. Author Contributions Conceived and designed the experiments: EAB ND RKG EA.

However, contemporary studies have indicated heterogeneity within adult stem-cell pools, and  novel culturing technique may address these limitations by selecting those for cell proliferation which are highly functional. Here, we report the preservation of stemness in human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) by using microgravity conditions combined with microspheres in  stirred suspension. The cells were bound to microspheres (100 300  ) and cultured using  wave-stirring shaker. One-week cultures using polystyrene and collagen microspheres increased the proportions of SSEA-(+) hASCs .- and .-fold (.- and .-fold increases in their numbers), respectively, compared to normal culture conditions. These cultured hASCs expressed higher levels of pluripotent markers (OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, and KLF), and had improved abilities for proliferation, colony formation, network formation, and multiple-mesenchymal differentiation. We believe that this novel culturing method may further enhance regenerative therapies using hASCs. Keywords: adipose-derived stem cell; microgravity culture; polystyrene microsphere; collagen microsphere; multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring cell . Introduction Human adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) are easily isolated therapeutic stem cells from adipose tissue. They have increasingly been used to ameliorate  broad range of refractory diseases, including irradiated tissue [], ischemic wounds [], and diabetic ulcers []. However, their clinical ef cacy has been limited because the long-term survival of transplanted hASCs is diminished by environmental stress [ ]. Consequently, hASC therapeutic mechanisms have been limited to the secretion of cytokines and growth factors to promote cell recruitment, immunomodulation, extracellular matrix remodeling, and angiogenesis [ 10]. In contrast, embryonic stem cells retain their potency and are thought to be superior to adult stem cells for regenerative potential [11]. However, the use of embryonic stem cells is limited by ethical issues [12]. Modern research has made gains toward  better understanding of stem-cell hetero- geneity [13,14]. Within stem-cell pools (previously thought to be homogenous),  surprising degree of subpopulation dynamics in gene expression has been revealed related to tissue regeneration, cell survival, proliferation, and stemness [15]. This concept of functional individuality within  stem-cell pool is especially important for hASCs, because cells with higher functional properties would be expected to have more promising therapeutic bene-  ts through an increased capacity to survive under dif cult conditions, to differentiate into various mesenchymal cell types, and to home into damaged tissues [16 18]. One example Cells 2021, 10, 560. Cells 2021, 10, 560  of 18 of  highly functional hASC candidate is the multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring (Muse) cell, which can be isolated from hASCs using its expression of stage-speci  em- bryonic antigen- (SSEA-) [19] and has been reported to have novel potential for liver cirrhosis [20], brain infarction [21], and aortic aneurysm [22] treatments. An additional problem is that the expansion of such highly-pluripotent cell popu- lations is quite dif cult. Adhesion-based cultures, the standard technique for in vitro expansion of hASCs, are known to lead to  gradual quiescence in stemness indicated, for example, by  decline in CD34 positivity [23]. In contrast, suspension-type cultures have also been used successfully for temporary cultivations of Muse cells, and although the mechanism is unknown, it has been reported that  microgravity (.., weightless) environment had  positive effect on stem-cell cultures for maintenance of their original potencies [24]. However, the forced- oating of hASC cultures using non-adherent dishes caused spherical aggregations and oxygen/nutrient diffusion limits, which resulted in central necrosis in hASC spheroids [25]. There is, therefore, an urgent need for new and ad- vanced culture techniques to permit the selective expansion of hASC subpopulations with improved properties for proliferation, differentiation, angiogenesis, immunosuppression, and stress-resistance. The microcarrier system was  rst introduced in 1967 for the growth of  broblasts [26], and has been used for the expansion of other adherent cells such as chondrocytes [27], hepatocytes [28], neural stem cells [29], and hASCs [30,31]. Microcarriers are usually small spherical particles which can adhere to cultivated cells and are characterized by higher surface-to-volume ratios that can accommodate higher cell densities compared to monolayer cultures. Most importantly, under the dynamic conditions of continuous shaking, microcarrier culturing has  multidirectional gravity effect on the adhered cells, effectively mimicking  oating cultures. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of dynamic microgravity culturing of hASCs using microcarriers to selectively expand highly functional stem-cell subpopulations. . Materials and Methods .. Primary Culture of hASCs Human lipoaspirates were obtained from 12 healthy female donors, average age 42. . years (mean   SD) and average body mass index of 22. . kg/m2, who underwent abdominal liposuction. Each patient provided written informed consent, and the research protocol was approved by the institutional review board. The stromal vascular fraction (SVF) was isolated from the lipoaspirates as described previously [23]. Brie , aspirated fat tissue was digested using .075% collagenase (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan) at 37   for 30 min on  shaker. After centrifugation (800   for 10 min), SVF cells were obtained as cellular pellets,  ltered through 100, 70, and 40   mesh, and resuspended. The SVF cells were plated at  density of    105 nucleated cells/100 mm dish and cultured at 37   in an atmosphere of % carbon dioxide in humid air. Cells were grown in Dulbecco  Modi ed Eagle Medium with Ham  -12 (DMEM/F12; Wako Pure Chemical Industries) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary cells were cultured until near con uence. Then, the adherent cells were released using  proteolytic enzyme treatment (TrypLE Express, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), de ned as passage  (P0) hASCs, and transferred to another dish. Once the adherent hASCs reached 80% con uency, cells were passaged using TrypLE Express, and P3 hASCs were used in the following experiments. Using  multicolor  ow cytometer (MACS-Quant, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany), P3 hASCs were characterized for the positive expressions of CD73, CD90, and CD105 and the negative expression of CD45 before use. .. Characterization of SSEA--Positive Cells in the hASC Pool First, SSEA- marker expression was assessed in normal hASCs using  ow cytometry. Adherent P3 hASCs from each donor were detached using TrypLE Express, centrifuged, and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The cells were sieved through\n\nCells 2021, 10, 560  of 18 and 40   mesh  lters, pelleted by centrifugation, and then resuspended for analysis. The isolated cells were incubated with rat anti-SSEA- antibody (:50; BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) and detected using an  uorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rat IgM (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA, USA). Analyses were performed using  multicolor  ow cytometer (MACS-Quant). Control gates were set based on staining with  labeled non-speci  antibody (matched isotype control immunoglobulin  (IgG)); no more than .% of the cells were deemed positive using the non-speci  antibody. To assess the stress durability of SSEA--positive cells, adherent P3 hASCs were ex- posed to  variety of optimized stress conditions (heat, 45   for  min; low-pH solution (pH = ) for 60 min; proteolysis, TrypLE Express for 20  at 37  ; hypotonia, Milli- water for  min; and mechanostress, transferred 30 times between two syringes through  connector with  small hole). One day after stress exposure, cell numbers and viability were measured using  dual- uorescence automated cell counter (Luna-FL, Logos Biosys- tems, Gyeonggi-do, Korea), and SSEA- positivity was detected by  ow cytometry after gating dead cells from live cells using -amino-actinomycin  (7AAD, BD Biosciences)  uorescence ( = 12). .. Preparation of Microspheres Two kinds of microspheres were used as cell carriers during cell culture. First, crosslinked polystyrene microspheres (Polystyrene Beads Large, Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA) with diameters between 200 300   were used. For good cell attachment, the polystyrene surfaces were hydrophilized using  30 min plasma treatment from  vacuum plasma apparatus (YHS- , Sakigake-Semiconductor, Kyoto, Japan). Ten grams of polystyrene microspheres (approximately . million microbeads with  total surface area of 4000 cm2) were washed three times in 70% ethanol for sterilization and diluted in 15 mL of PBS. Secondly, collagen microspheres (100 200   diameters, Cellagen; Koken, Tokyo, Japan) manufactured from reconstituted collagen obtained from bovine skin and crosslinked with .% hexamethylene diisocyanate were used. Pre-sterilized vials (15 mL) contained approximately three million collagen beads with  total surface area of approximately 4000 cm2. .. hASC Loading onto Microspheres for Microgravity Culture The two types of microspheres were washed with PBS and resuspended in warm culture medium overnight (DMEM/F12) prior to use. Polystyrene and collagen micro- sphere solutions (. mL), representing  total surface area of approximately 80 cm2, were added to . cm diameter, non-adherent, polystyrene dishes (Corning Inc., Corning, NY, USA). The dishes were placed onto  continuous-action shaker (Wave-PR, Taitec, Saitama, Japan), capable of shaking the microspheres in three dimensions by combining movements from two axes (rotary and seesaw). As  result, the cumulative gravity vector toward the microspheres was minimized towards zero (.., microgravity). The unit was driven by  computer system which allowed for the adjustment of rotation speed and shaking angle (see Video S1). For each dish on the shaker,    105 P3 hASCs were suspended in 300   of DMEM/F12 and incubated at 37   in an atmosphere of % carbon dioxide in humid air. After allowing the mixture of cells and microcarriers to settle for 30 min,  min of shaking was started at  setting of 10 rpm and  shaking angle of  degrees, and then stopped for  further 28 min. This 30 min procedure was repeated eight times (  total) to allow the cells to adhere to the microspheres circumferentially. Then, DMEM/F12 was added (. mL) and the suspension was stirred continuously at 15 rpm at   shaking angle. Using this continuous stirring, the cells experienced  microgravity environment while being strongly attached to the microspheres. Culturing continued for up to two weeks, and the culture medium was changed twice per week as follows; after allowing the microspheres to settle, half of the supernatant was exchanged for fresh medium. Cells 2021, 10, 560  of 18 .. Cell Retrieval from Microspheres When ready for analysis, the cell microcarrier complexes obtained from the culture dishes were transferred to new tubes (15 mL) and sedimented. For each tube, the super- natant was removed, and the complexes were washed using PBS. Cells were enzymatically released by incubation with  mL of TrypLE Express for 15 min at 37  . Cell suspensions were diluted with additional culture medium ( mL) and sieved through 100 and 40   mesh collector screens. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 600   for  min, and then resuspended for analysis. No microcarriers (fractured or intact) were seen in the retrieved cell suspensions. .. Cell Growth in Microsphere Cultures Numerical measurement of viable cells cultured on polystyrene and collagen micro- spheres, or in polystyrene and collagen dishes was carried out using  dual- uorescence automated cell counter (Luna-FL). P3 hASCs (   105) were seeded onto polystyrene and collagen microspheres under dynamic conditions, or onto polystyrene and collagen dishes as static monolayer cultures. The cells were retrieved by trypsinization and counted on days , , , , and 14, and growth rates were calculated (.., hASC growth rate = hASC number on day /day ). Data were gathered from six separate samples.",

For the observing the collagen microspheres,  cryo-SEM technique at  130   was used so as not to scatter and lose uncharged microspheres. .. Proliferation of SSEA--Positive hASCs in Microsphere Cultures To determine whether microsphere culturing and/or dynamic conditions enhanced the proliferation of highly functional hASCs, we assessed cell number, viability, and SSEA- -positivity using  ow cytometry in six groups: hASCs retrieved from either polystyrene or collagen microcarriers under dynamic conditions, those retrieved from either polystyrene or collagen microcarriers under static conditions, and those retrieved from either polystyrene or collagen dishes. The number of SSEA-(+) cells was measured after seven days of culture under each condition, and growth rates were calculated (.., SSEA-(+) growth rate = SSEA-(+) cell number on day /day ). Six separate samples were used for the data analysis. .. Immunocytochemistry P3 hASCs were cultured for seven days on polystyrene or collagen microspheres, and in polystyrene or collagen dishes,  xed with % paraformaldehyde, washed in PBS, and permeabilized with .% Triton -100 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Cells were incubated for 16  (  ) with the following primary antibodies: anti-OCT4 (GeneTex, Irvine, CA, USA); anti-SOX2 (GeneTex); anti-NANOG (N3C3, GeneTex); and anti-SSEA- (EMD Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany).

Colony-Forming Assay P3 hASCs were cultured either with polystyrene or collagen microspheres under dynamic conditions or in polystyrene dishes for seven days, and then seeded (   102 cells) into polystyrene -well plates. Cells were incubated at 37   for ten days,  xed with methanol, stained with cresyl violet solution, and then counted using digital imaging software (Photoshop; Adobe Systems Inc., San Jose, CA, USA) ( = ). .11. In Vitro Angiogenesis (Network Formation) Assay P3 hASCs were cultured either with polystyrene or collagen microspheres under dynamic conditions or in polystyrene dishes for seven days, and then cell-network for- mation was assessed. Matrigel (BD Biosciences) was applied to 96-well plates (50   per well) and polymerized (30 min at 37  ). After incubation in endothelial basal medium (EBM; Cambrex, Walkersville, MD, USA) containing % fetal bovine serum for 24  as  pretreatment, 5000 cells (resuspended in 50   of EBM) were plated into the Matrigel wells and cultured for  . Branch formation was observed with phase microscopy, and the lengths of cytoplasmic extensions per  eld were calculated ( = ). .12. Multilineage Differentiation Assay P3 hASCs were cultured either with polystyrene or collagen microspheres under dy- namic conditions or in polystyrene dishes for seven days, and then differentiated into adi- pogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic lineages ( = ). Cells were seeded into polystyrene -well plates and incubated in DMEM/F12 until con uent. Adipogenic/osteogenic differ- entiation was initiated using either adipogenic medium (Adipolife; Lifeline Cell Technology, Frederick, MD, USA) or osteogenic medium (Osteolife; Lifeline Cell Technology). After culturing for 21 days (medium changed every three days), adipogenic ability was analyzed qualitatively with oil red  staining and quantitatively with AdipoRed reagent (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland). Osteogenic ability was analyzed qualitatively using von Kossa staining and quantitatively by Calcium- testing (Wako Pure Chemicals). Chondrogenic differen- tiation was conducted using  micromass culture system; hASCs were resuspended in\n\nCells 2021, 10, 560  of 18 chondrogenic medium (Chondrolife; Lifeline Cell Technology) and centrifuged (800   for  min). Half of the medium was changed after centrifugation every two days. After two weeks, chondrogenic ability was analyzed qualitatively using Alcian blue staining and quantitatively by measuring micromass diameters. .13. Statistics Data were analyzed using SPSS package 23. (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and Kyplot . (Freeware). Based on the Kolmogorov Smirnov test, the data were normally dis- tributed within the donor populations. Therefore,  one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni adjustments for post-hoc comparisons were used to determine signi cant differences between means ( < .05 representing signi cance, unless otherwise stated). . Results .. Characterization of SSEA--Positive hASCs Cells were expanded for three passages before characterization using  ow cytometry and combinations of mesenchymal-cell surface markers. We found that 94. .% of cells were positive for CD105, CD90, and CD73, and that 99. .% were negative for CD45. Then, the total number of cells, their viability, and SSEA--positivity of viable cells were assessed in normal hASCs (control) and in  ve kinds of stress-treated hASCs. One day after stress exposure, even though all stressed groups showed signi cant reductions (62. 74.%) in viable cells compared to the control group, stressed cells exhibited higher proportions of SSEA-(+) cells (heat, .%; low pH, .%; proteolysis, .%; hypotonia, .%; mechanostress, .%) compared to controls (.%) (Figure 1A). No signi cant differences were detected in the overall numbers of SSEA-(+) cells between stress-treated hASCs and normal hASCs, with the exception of the mechanostress group, which showed  signi cantly lower number of SSEA-(+) cells ( < .01) (Figure 1B,). .. Cell Growth in Microgravity Microsphere Cultures Adherent cells are continuously affected by the downward force of gravity throughout the culture period, but cells attached to continuously stirred microspheres are affected by multidirectional gravitational forces (.., microgravity) (Figure 2A). The numbers of hASCs were decreased in both polystyrene and collagen microsphere cultures on day , suggesting that some cells did not successfully adhere to the microbeads (Figure 2B). However, the growth rates (.., hASC number on day /day ) used to estimate true cell proliferation showed no signi cant differences between groups (polystyrene microsphere, .; collagen microsphere, .; polystyrene dish, .; collagen dish, .). On day 14, there were no signi cant differences in the numbers of hASCs retrieved from each culture, possibly because the monolayer cultures reached con uency. Visualizations of hASCs that were adhered to polystyrene and collagen microspheres at culture-day  revealed their successful proliferation (Figure 2C). .. Proliferation of SSEA--Positive hASCs in Microgravity/Microsphere Cultures As described above, the numbers of viable hASCs on day  were lower in the microsphere-cultured groups, regardless of the material (polystyrene or collagen) or the condition (dynamic or static), compared to the dish-cultured groups (Figure 3A). However, when compared to polystyrene monolayer cultures (as controls), the static-condition polystyrene and collagen microsphere cultures produced .-fold and .-fold propor- tional increases, and .-fold and .-fold increases in the numbers of SSEA-(+) hASCs, respectively ( < .05 for both). In addition, the dynamic-culture conditions produced .-fold and .-fold proportional increases, and .-fold and .-fold increases in the numbers of SSEA-(+) hASCs compared to the dish cultures, respectively ( < .001 for both) (Figure 3B,). These results indicate positive effects for both the microsphere and microgravity conditions on SSEA-(+) cell proliferation and on SSEA-(+) cell growth rates (.., growth rate = SSEA-(+) cell number on day /day ) Table .

Discussions Through novel advances in cell biology, adult stem cells (including hASCs) have been shown to be truly heterogeneous, with subpopulations of cells that may offer poten- tially greater translational bene ts. SSEA-(+) Muse cells,  representative type of highly functional mesenchymal stem cell, are known to show superior multipotency compared to regular stem cells [32]. However, although routine two-dimensional cultures allow hASCs to expand easily, these conditions adversely affect the proliferation of cells with higher multipotent properties, reducing the usual proportion of SSEA-(+) hASCs to only approximately % [19]. Growing evidence suggests that mechanical and environmental stress greatly in uences proliferation, self-renewal, differentiation, and the multipotency of stem cells [33,34]. Among possible sources of stress, gravity may historically have been the most underappreciated microenvironment stress, because of its constant in uence on cultured cells. Numerous studies have reported the impact of microgravity conditions on stem-cell proliferation [35] and differentiation [36,37]. Notably, human mesenchymal stem cells cul- tured in  microgravity environment usually demonstrate suppressed differentiation [38]. Therefore, some highly functional stem cells may be able to retain their undifferentiated, unaltered phenotypes if they can avoid the force of gravity during culture. According to previous studies, controlled rotation around two axes can minimize the cumulative gravity vector to an average of 10    over time [24]. In our experimental system, although cells were attached to microsphere surfaces, the culture medium containing the micro- spheres was stirred by controlled rotation around two axes. As  result, the cells  gravity vectors were randomly and continuously changing, with their  nal cumulative gravity vectors being minimized toward zero. Some microgravity-simulating devices have been developed [39,40], but they involve signi cant costs and are very dif cult to standardize. Moreover, even such devices created large cell clusters which represent the limit of cell- proliferative capacity [25] and reinforce the advantage of the present adhesive conditions for the large-scale expansion of hASCs [41]. In previous studies, micro-scale carriers fabricated from  variety of natural and syn- thetic polymers have shown signi cant potential for cell growth, speci  differentiation, and the delivery of hASCs [42,43]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no investigation has been carried out on the feasibility of culturing cells using stirred microspheres for the stated purpose of mimicking  microgravity environment. The outcomes of this study exceeded our expectations. Seven days of polystyrene and collagen microsphere cultures under static conditions produced an increased number of SSEA-(+) hASCs compared to polystyrene dish cultures, and those under dynamic conditions exhibited  much higher number of SSEA-(+) hASCs. These results clearly revealed  positive in uence of micro- spheres on the selective proliferation of SSEA-(+) cells, especially in those experiments combined with  microgravity environment. By comparison, our stress-exposure treatments were not very suitable for the expan- sion of SSEA-(+) hASCs. Heneidi et al. reported that Muse cells could be isolated from lipoaspirates using severe cellular stress, such as long-term exposure to collagenase [44]. We also con rmed that exposure to proteolysis produced the best results among our stress conditions, increasing the proportion of SSEA-(+) hASCs by .-fold (.%) compared to monolayer cultures (.%). During preliminary studies (unpublished data) to enhance the ratio of SSEA-(+) hASCs (known to be stress-tolerant [19,32]), stress magnitude was carefully optimized in each experiment. However, because 37.% of viable cells were lost, the  nal number of proteolytic solution-treated SSEA-(+) hASCs was only .-fold more (. 103) compared to the controls (. 103), with no statistically signi cant difference. These results suggest that exposure to severe stress can concentrate SSEA-(+) hASCs through the selective depletion of SSEA-( ) cells, but such stress can also inhibit cell proliferation. Instead of concentration, microsphere cultures under microgravity condi- tions increased SSEA-(+) hASCs by proliferation (Figure ). In other words, the present microgravity culture conditions increased not only the proportion, but also the number,\n\nCells 2021, 10, 560 15 of 18 of SSEA-(+) cells to actualize regenerative therapies requiring these highly therapeutic cells. However,  limitation of this study is that we only assessed SSEA- as  pluripotent marker in stress-exposure experiments. Additional research including analyses of the other pluripotent markers (.., Oct4 and Sox2) may further emphasize the differences between microgravity cultures and stress-exposure cultures, or reveal new characteristics of the two cultures. Figure . Schematic representation of the study. Human adipose-derived stem cells are normally capable of heterogeneous potency. Exposure to stress can selectively deplete regular stem cells, but does not increase the number of highly functional stem cells. In contrast, microgravity/microsphere cultures can selectively cause the proliferation of highly functional cell subpopulations to reach the numbers required for regenerative therapies. Furthermore, hASCs harvested from microgravity microsphere cultures had higher expression levels of the pluripotent markers OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, MYC, KLF, and CD34 compared to hASCs cultured in monolayers. OCT4 and NANOG are known to be involved in the self-renewal of human embryonic stem cells, while SOX2, MYC, and KLF expression act as transcription factors to control genes involved during embryonic development [19]. CD34 has been reported to contribute to the proliferative ability of hASCs both by us [23,45] and by others [46,47]. However, the upregulation of nuclear stem-cell markers was hardly detected in hASCs from static microsphere cultures, suggesting that the microgravity environment may play  key role in preserving hASC functionality. In  previous report, space ight experiments demonstrated that altered gene expression was associated with epigenetic changes, such as chromatin re-modeling and DNA methylation [48]. The present results extend these observations by demonstrating improved proliferation, angiogenesis, and differentiation into mesenchymal lineages (adipocytes, osteocytes, and chondrocytes) in hASCs from microgravity microsphere cultures compared to hASCs from cultures under\n\nCells 2021, 10, 560 16 of 18 normal conditions. However, the fold change of the genes analyzed by RT-PCR was not so large in this study (less than .), and future studies are required for further quali cation of these genes through optimization of the microgravity culture protocols. Interestingly, the ef cacies for collagen and polystyrene microspheres to select for proliferation in highly functional hASCs were roughly equivalent in the present study. Polystyrene microbeads require  plasma coating prior to use to enable good cell attach- ment; therefore, collagen microbeads may be the superior practical choice for regenerative therapy applications. In addition, as  biodegradable biomaterial, collagen has the ad- vantage that such beads may be clinically administered into  target organ together with hASCs; it may even augment hASC survival and functionality after transplantation by acting as  biological cell scaffold [,42]. . Conclusions We cultured hASCs with microspheres using three-dimensional movement to create microgravity conditions for the preservation of stemness, while at the same time preserving cell microsphere adhesion to maximize cell quantities. This new cell-culturing technique selectively enhanced the proliferation of highly functional stem cells, demonstrating supe- rior stemness, proliferation, differentiation, and angiogenic abilities, which may provide for enhanced treatments for intractable human diseases compared to current hASC treatments. However, further studies are required to optimize  culture protocol to maximize the selective expansion ef ciency and to investigate the therapeutic value of these cells using in vivo experiments before clinical trials can proceed.",

However, the mechanisms by which organisms respond to this stress remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the impact of three different gravitational loadings (microgravity, /  [lunar gravity], and  ) on the behavior, bone, thymus, and spleen of mice housed for 25 35 days in the International Space Station. The bone density reduction under microgravity was mostly recovered by   but only partially recovered by / . Both   and /  suppressed microgravity-induced changes in some osteoblast and osteoclast marker gene expression. Thymus atrophy induced by microgravity was half recovered by both   and / , but gene expression changes were not fully recovered by / . While no histological changes were observed due to low gravity, alterations in gene expression were noted in the spleen. We found that in bone and thymus, lunar gravity reduced microgravity-induced histological alterations and partially reversed gene expression changes. This study highlighted organ-specific variations in responsiveness to gravity, serving as an animal test for establishing  molecular-level gravity threshold for maintaining  healthy state during future spaceflight.

To further explore space, the manned lunar exploration program  Artemis  has been initiated, and research is underway to address the various obstacles to the space environment1,. Notably, astronauts experience various environmental challenges during spaceflight including microgravity, psychological stress, and high space radiation. These changes pose significant threats to the various physiological functions of astronauts. prolonged stay in space induces changes, such as the deterioration of bones3,, skeletal muscle function3, vestibular control5, optic nerve papillary edema6, and cardiac hypertrophy7 among astronauts. These health issues are mainly managed through effective exercise in space; however, the mechanisms causing these changes are unknown. Several drawbacks must be considered for humans to explore space. In addition, it is difficult to verify effects on the human space environment. Research activities at the International Space Station (ISS) have been conducted on various microorganisms, plants, and animals8. To stably house mice, which are higher life forms, on the ISS, we developed breeding facilities in accordance with animal ethics guidelines, and housed mice on the ISS for approximately one month on five occasions, including the mission reported here, and all mice returned to Earth alive. To conduct space exploration, we must understand biological effects at the molecular level to adapt to space environments such as gravity on the Moon and Mars. It is important to study the effects of long-term gravitational fluctuations on living organisms, to prepare for future space exploration. In 2016, we successfully housed 12 mice in the ISS under either microgravity or artificial   for 35 days using the Multiple Artificial- gravity Research System (MARS), which can exhibit varying gravitational forces using  centrifugal device (Mouse Habitat Unit (MHU)- mission),10. All the mice were alive after returning to Earth. The success of the MHU mission has been reported in the effects of microgravity on various organs, including skeletal muscles10,11, bone10, eye12, spleen13, thymus14, reproductive system15,16, and behavior17,18. For future manned exploration of the Moon and Mars, it is necessary to understand the effects of partial gravity of less than   on living organisms. Recently, the effects of lunar gravity on mice have been explored using MARS with two different short- and long- radius centrifuge lengths on the ISS (the MHU- and - missions in 2019 and 2020, respectively). Here, analysis of the soleus muscle of mice revealed that muscle atrophy and muscle fiber type might be regulated by different gravitational forces19. This study aimed to present the physiological effects of three different gravity environments on mice during three MHU missions (MHU-, -, and -), based on histological characteristics and gene expression. We found that lunar gravity suppressed histological changes in the thymus, partially recovered bone mass loss, and partially recovered microgravity-induced changes in gene expression in bone, thymus, and spleen. Furthermore, the responsiveness to gravity varied in different organs; this research will serve as an animal test to elucidate the gravity threshold for each organ at the molecular level required to maintain  healthy state for future space travel. Results and discussion Overview of three mouse habitat unit (MHU) missions Figure 1A presents an overview of three MHU missions (MHU-, -, and -). C57BL/6J male mice in the Transporting Cage Unit (TCU) were launched aboard the SpaceX Dragon Space Vehicle from the NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida, and subsequently transported to the ISS. In the ISS, mice were transferred to the Habitat Cage Unit (HCU), one mouse per cage, and then placed in  centrifuge under the conditions described below for 35 days (MHU-), 25 days (MHU-), and 26 days (MHU-). For the MHU- mission, 12 mice were divided into two groups: microgravity (MG) and artificial   (AG) mice. The AG group was kept in an artificial   environment in the MARS- centrifuge. In the MHU- and - missions, six partial gravity (PG) mice were kept in an artificial /  environment in MARS- and MARS- centrifuges, respectively. MARS- is approximately . times larger in diameter than MARS-, which decreases the gravity gradient, allowing for more precise gravity settings. The ground control (GC) mice were an experimental group of C57BL/6J male mice of the same age, maintained under the same breeding conditions in the HCU as the space experiment in each mission. Experiments were conducted using six mice per mission group. more detailed schedule for each mission is provided in Supplementary Fig. . Unavoidably, it took   days of transport time after the cargo landed to collect each organ. This information is detailed in the Method section. For both missions, the change in body weight before and after the space experiment occurred at approximately the same rate of increase19. In addition, three mice in MHU- experienced significant weight loss after returning to Earth due to anomalies in the TCU water supply system. These mice were not used for the analysis of RNA-seq. Behavioral tests Prior to dissecting the mice after anesthetizing them with isoflurane, we visually inspected their appearance, body hair, whisker morphology, incisor tooth morphology, abdominal hardness, and limb morphology. None of the mice returning to Earth from the three missions showed any abnormalities. Following body weight measurements,  mid-air righting reflex test and rotarod test were performed to assess vestibular function and coordinated movements (Fig. 1B,). In MHU-, the latency to right tended to increase non-significantly in MG mice (176   19 ms) compared to those in artificial   (AG) and ground control (1GC) mice (143   12 ms and 130    ms, respectively) (Fig. 1B). Regardless of the same gravitational environment, the latency to right of partial gravity (4PG) mice (212    ms) in MHU- was significantly higher than that of 4GC mice (155    ms), whereas that of 5PG mice (145   19 ms) in MHU- was comparable to that of 5GC mice (150    ms). In the rotarod test, the duration on the rod in AG (48    ) and MG (44    ) mice was significantly shorter than that in 1GC (74   10 ) mice in the MHU- mission (Fig. 1C). However, the differences between PG and GC in MHU- (4PG: 49    , 4GC: 37    ) and MHU- (5PG: 83   11 , 5GC: 70   14 ) were not significant. In the righting reflex test, which evaluates postural control via the vestibular system, mice from the MARS- and Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:28774  |  www.nature.com/scientificreports/\n\nMARS- in the same /  group showed different results. 4PG showed the same deterioration as MG, whereas 5PG showed the same results as GC and AG in the   group. The two possible reasons for this discrepancy are as follows: () Difference between the short and long arms: the gravity gradient in the housing chamber of MARS-, which has short arms, is larger than that of MARS-, which has long arms. Therefore, each time the height of the head changes, 4PG receives  larger gravitational input into the otolith system. This may have affected vestibular function. () Difference in the control performance of the centrifuge used in 4PG and 5PG. The difference is particularly noticeable in  small gravity, such as / ; the gravity fluctuation was larger in 4PG than that in 5PG, which may have affected vestibular function in 4PG. These two possibilities should be examined in future research. Lunar gravity loading partially recovered bone mass loss caused by microgravity To investigate the effect of gravity on bones, the right femur of the mice was analyzed using micro-computed tomography (Fig. 2A,). MG mice in the MHU- mission showed  significant decrease of 70% (1GC; 15. .%, AG; 14. .%, MG; . .%) in the trabecular bone volume corrected by the tissue volume (BV/TV), whereas PG mice in the MHU- and - missions showed  significant decrease in BV/TV of only 30% (4GC; 20. .%, 4PG; 14. .%) and 28% (5GC; 27. .%, 5PG; 19. .%), respectively, although housing in MHU- and - was 10 days shorter than that in MHU-.

Although BV/TV decreased in the /  environment, the degree of decrease was smaller than that in the microgravity environment, suggesting that bone loss was partially prevented in the /  environment compared with that in microgravity. Moreover, plasma levels of the bone resorption marker, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) significantly increased while those of the bone formation marker, osteocalcin significantly decreased in the MG and two of the PG mice compared to those in GC mice (Fig. 2C). However, compared to the increased proportion of TRAP (139%, 1GC; . . Unit/, MG; . . Unit/) and decreased proportion of osteocalcin (49%, 1GC; 60. 19. ng/mL, MG; 30. . ng/mL) in MG mice relative to that in 1GC mice, the proportions of TRAP (MHU-: 127%, 4GC; . . Unit/, 4PG; . .

Moreover, the similarity in osteocalcin values between AG and MG mice in MHU- indicated that the regulation of osteocalcin expression may be independent of gravity. Comparison of gene expression in osteocyte-rich bone tissues during microgravity and lunar gravity To verify how gravity affects gene expression in load-bearing bones, we collected and prepared femurs and tibiae20 for RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of an osteocyte-rich bone fraction. total of 485 genes with  false discovery rate (FDR) < .05 between MG and 1GC mice were visualized using cluster heat mapping among MG, AG, 1GC in MHU- and 4PG, 4GC in MHU-, revealing five distinct gene clusters (Fig. 3A). Similar clusters between samples were not classified by the magnitude of gravity, but by each of the MHU- and - missions. The results indicated that the changes in gene expression at /  were lesser than those in microgravity. However, as observed in previous comparisons of our thymic RNA-seq data14, this may be due to differences in flight schedules between missions. Since this makes changes in gene expression classified into clusters  and  less credible, the present study focused on clusters , , and . Gene ontology (GO) analysis identified actin regulation-related genes in cluster  (Fig. 3B). Considering that the cytoskeleton is an initial gravity sensor20, this upregulation could be caused by transmitting variations in external mechanical forces into intracellular chemical signals. Cluster  and , downregulated in MG mice, included genes responsible for the dysfunction of mitochondria and the cell cycle; abnormalities in the cell cycle of osteoblasts have been previously reported in microgravity experiments21 (Fig. 3B). Although these genes were downregulated in the microgravity environment, they were suppressed in the /  environment. Enhancement of osteoblast and osteoclast signals under microgravity The unloading environment during spaceflight causes loss of bone mass in mice23,24, which is induced by inhibited osteoblastic bone formation and enhanced osteoclastic bone resorption in  simulated microgravity environment25. However, since AG and lunar gravity had not been used in these studies, the effect of different loading gravities on gene expression in bone during spaceflight remains unclear. Hence, to elucidate the effects of microgravity, / , and   onboard environment on the gene expression in the osteocyte-rich bone fraction, eight osteoblast lineage marker genes and seven osteoclast marker genes were selected and visualized using heat mapping (Fig. 3C). We compared the expression levels of osteoblast markers Bglap, Bmp4, Sost, and Spp1, which are mainly expressed by osteoblasts and osteocytes in bone and regulate osteoblastic bone formation. The expressions of Sost, Bmp4, and Spp1 were significantly higher in MG mice than those in 1GC mice. However, Bglap expression was significantly lower in MG mice than that in 1GC, and tended to be lower than that in AG mice. In addition, these changes were absent when comparing 4GC and 4PG mice in the MHU- mission (Fig. 3D). Changes in Bglap expression in the osteocyte-rich bone fraction and the plasma concentrations of its product, osteocalcin, were similar between the experimental groups (Fig. 2C). Though bone loss during spaceflight is mainly caused by osteoblast inhibition, our results showed that the gene expressions of some osteoblasts increased after approximately one month of flight. recent study using medaka fish showed that osteoblast marker genes are upregulated immediately after exposure to microgravity22. Therefore, the gene upregulation in our study might have occurred during the early phase of spaceflight. In contrast, Bglap expression was significantly downregulated under microgravity. In  previous 14-day space experiment, murine osteoblasts showed reduced expression of transcription factors and proteins involved in osteoblast differentiation23. This suggests potential negative regulation of gene expression for osteoblast differentiation during spaceflight, following an initial phase of upregulation. In summary, osteoblast-related genes may undergo distinct regulatory mechanisms contingent on the specific phase of spaceflight. Further, the expressions of osteoclast marker genes, Acp5 and Ctsk, both of which are specifically expressed by osteoclasts, regulate osteoclastic bone resorption, were significantly upregulated in MG mice compared to those in GC mice, and these changes were partially suppressed in PG mice (Fig. 3E). The changes in Acp5 expression between the experimental groups were similar to those in the plasma levels of TRAP, the product of Acp5. Thus, the expressions of osteoblast and osteoclast markers were significantly altered in the bone under microgravity, and these changes were mostly suppressed under AG and / , suggesting that the bone is highly sensitive to gravitational alterations. The thymus under lunar gravity is histologically normal, although microgravity does not prevent weight loss Following spaceflight, the thymus is known to undergo atrophy24 26, and findings of the MHU- mission also suggest that the weight of the thymus decreases in  microgravity environment, and artificial   partially prevents this decrease14.

In contrast, the mean thymus weight normalized by body weight in PG mice in MHU- and - decreased to 76.% (4GC; .44   .17, 4PG; .10   .22) and 79.% (5GC; .49   .14, 5PG; .18   .04) of that in GC mice, respectively. This indicates that /  and artificial   partially suppressed gravity-induced thymus reduction in mice (Fig. 4A). Hematoxylin eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemical analysis were performed to determine the cause of thymus weight loss due to housing in  /  environment. HE staining revealed no significant changes between PG and GC mice (Fig. 4B). This confirms that no abnormalities were also observed in the thymus of MG mice by HE staining carried out in our previous study14. In our previous study, immunostaining with anti-keratin- (Krt5;  marker for the medullary region) and keratin- (Krt-;  marker for the cortical region) in the thymus of MHU- MG mice showed that Krt5-positive medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) are mislocalized in the cortical region14. In the present study, no significant changes were observed in the global structure and size of the medullary and cortical regions in PG mice (Fig. 4C). Furthermore, immunostaining with anti-Aire ( transcription factor expressed in the medullary region), Ulex europaeus agglutinin  (UEA-;  marker for mTECs), and nuclei showed no differences between PG and GC mice (Fig. 4C). This result concurs with the lack of abnormality in the distribution of their expression, which we previously found to be unchanged among MG, AG, and GC mice in MHU-114. Thus, the abnormal distribution of thymic epithelial cells may depend on the degree of gravitational change. In summary, /  and artificial   partially countered thymic weight loss and prevented histological changes induced in the microgravity environment. Gene expression in the thymus under different gravitational loads RNA-seq analysis was performed to determine the effects of different gravitational environments on gene expression. total of 2880 genes with an FDR < .05 between MG and 1GC mice were visualized using cluster heat mapping, subsequently revealing five distinct clusters (Fig. 4D). Horizontal clustering between mice classified them into   group (1GC, 4GC, 5GC, and AG) and less than   group (4PG, 5PG, and MG).",

Furthermore, even in the   environment, the space experiment (AG) and GC experiments (1GC, 4GC, 5GC) were classified into different groups. This may reflect changes in the process of the space experiment and GC experiment. GO analysis further revealed that cluster , which was downregulated in PG and MG mice compared to that in GCs, contained genes associated with endothelial morphogenesis (Fig. 4E). Consistently, altered localization of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor has been reported in human CD34+ stem cells under simulated microgravity27. Cluster  and  indicated upregulated gene expression in PG and MG mice compared to those in GCs; particularly genes included in cluster  were only upregulated in MG mice. Clusters  and  included genes associated with cell migration. Thymic atrophy is caused by various physiological stressors, including aging and infections28 30. Previous studies using protozoan-infected mice have demonstrated thymic atrophy, wherein  cells migrate from the thymus to peripheral lymphoid organs31. Similarly, the effects of microgravity and /  may potentially induce the release of several molecular ligands that control cell migration and contribute to the establishment of thymic atrophy. Cluster  and , downregulated in MG mice, comprised genes associated with the cell cycle. RNA-seq analysis of the thymus from two independent flight experiments, MHU- and -, has revealed differences in the gene expression profiles between the two missions owing to differences in flight schedules and conditions14. Nevertheless, integrated results have shown an impact on cell cycle progression without significant signs of apoptosis enhancement in relatively long-duration spaceflight14. Consistently, apoptosis did not influence any of the five clusters. Moreover, our results implied the influence of cell cycle- regulating genes in clusters  and . Cluster  is downregulated in MG, but not in PG mice, suggesting that it contributes to the suppressing thymic weight loss in / . Cluster  showed different gene expression profiles between  and 5PG mice because centrifuges with different radii might affect the gravity gradient in the cage. Interestingly, the cell cycle may be affected by slight changes in gravity. Changes in gene expression in the mouse thymus due to hypergravity are inhibited by  surgical lesion in the vestibular apparatus of the inner ear32. The simultaneous exposure of human fibroblasts to simulated microgravity and radiation exhibits more pronounced effects on the expression of cell cycle-regulating genes than those with radiation exposure alone33. Hence, our results demonstrated the effect of gravity on the cell cycle in the space experiment by comparing the PG and MG mice. Additionally, osteosarcoma tumor growth and metastasis to the lungs have been reported during hindlimb unloading34. Therefore, it is critical to determine the cancer risk associated with changes in gravity. Future studies using other gravity loads will clarify the risks of thymus atrophy and carcinogenesis during spaceflight. Our previous study implied that artificial   can alleviate thymic atrophy during spaceflight despite AG mice experiencing slightly lower gravity than that of GC mice owing to the relatively small radius of cage rotation14. In this study, we showed that /  could alleviate thymic weight loss, similar to AG. However, gene expression profiles in PG mice were different from those in AG mice, which suggests that /  is still insufficient to attenuate all changes during spaceflight. Future studies using MARS are warranted to identify  gravity threshold that can prevent gene expression changes in space. In summary, the effects of both the space experimental procedure and low gravity on thymus atrophy may be involved, which is consistent with the clustering patterns of exhaustive gene expression. The effect of microgravity in the spleen was alleviated in lunar gravity The spleen is an important secondary lymphoid organ involved in the acquired immune responses during spaceflight35. Our previous study implied that erythrocyte-related genes regulated by the transcription factor GATA1 are significantly downregulated in the spleen of MG mice in the MHU- mission13. To elucidate the effect of /  on secondary lymphoid organs, we analyzed the histological and gene expression changes in the spleen. Body weight-normalized spleen weights in MG mice tended to be lower than those in GC mice; the Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:28774  |  www.nature.com/scientificreports/\n\nFig. .

Our previous HE staining results showed that MG and PG mice have  normal splenic structure with white and red pulps (Fig. 5B). Furthermore, no specific abnormalities are observed in immunostaining with Ter119 (erythrocyte marker), B220 ( cell marker), and CD3e ( cell marker), similar to those reported previously in MG mice13 (Fig. 5C). RNA-seq analysis of the spleen was performed to comprehensively investigate the impact of different gravitational forces on gene expression. total of 94 genes (FDR < .05) between MG and 1GC mice were visualized using cluster heat mapping, revealing five distinct clusters (Fig. 5D). These genes were also classified by horizontal clustering into mice experiencing spaceflight (5PG, MG, and AG) and mice in the ground control (1GC, 4GC, and 5GC), indicating that the general gene expression changes in the spleen were caused by the space environment and experimental processes rather than by gravity changes. Although difficult to comprehend, data from 4PG mice were dispersed in both these groups. Based on the results of horizontal clustering, the relevant factors of the space experiment, such as radiation or stress, may have largely affected gene expression profiles in the spleen. Therefore, we further compared gene expressions among 4PG, 5PG, MG, and AG mice to elucidate the effects of different gravitational loads. total of 167 genes with an FDR < .05 between MG and AG mice were visualized using cluster heat mapping, revealing three distinct clusters (Fig. 5E). Horizontal clustering classified them into   (AG) and less than   (4PG, 5PG, and MG) groups, indicating that PG mice showed gene expression patterns similar to those of MG mice. GO analysis also suggested that cluster , with upregulated gene expression in PG and MG mice, included genes associated with the inflammatory response (Supplementary Fig. ). In cluster , upregulation was observed only in MG mice, suggesting that /  could partially alleviate the gene expression changes in microgravity. We further compared the expression of erythrocyte-related genes in the spleen. Erythrocyte-related genes, regulated by Gata1 and Tal1, are downregulated due to the combined effect of space environments13. Moreover, experiments in Nrf2 (NF-E2-related factor-) knockout mice suggest that these changes are not induced by flight-related stress but by other space-specific factors36. To elucidate the effect of different gravitational forces on erythroid genes, we compared the expression of 19 genes regulated by Gata1 and Tal1 (Fig. 5F). All genes were downregulated in MG and both PG mice, but these reductions were partially alleviated in AG mice. Furthermore, we compared the expression levels of Alas2, Slc4a1, Hba-a2, and Rhag, which are known to regress after spaceflight regardless of Nrf2 expression36 (Fig. 5G). The expression levels of Alas2, Slc4a1, and Hba-a2 were significantly lower in MG mice than those in GC mice. Moreover, these changes were not observed in either AG or PG mice. Consequently, gravity loading may partially rescue the downregulation of these erythropoiesis- related genes. This observation aligns with the hypothesis that weightlessness contributes to anemia during spaceflight37. Although we have uncovered novel facts that can only be elucidated through space experiments, our study has several limitations. First, because our space experiments only used mice, it is unclear whether our findings can be applied to human biology. Another limitation is that the tissue samples were collected on the second day after the mice returned to Earth. Therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that our data, especially the RNA-seq data, were altered by the effects of exposure to the   environment. Although space experiments must address various issues to be implemented, this study will serve as  resource for future research. In conclusion, using MARS, we evaluated the effects of microgravity and /  in the bone, thymus, and spleen. In the bone and thymus, morphological and gene expression changes induced in microgravity were not completely alleviated in / . In contrast, the gravitational threshold for the spleen exited around / , considering the preserved splenic weight and structure. Thus, responsiveness to gravity, phenotypic abnormalities, and gene expression patterns varied in each organ. In addition, two different centrifuges were used to generate /  in MHU- and -, with different centrifuge radii, resulting in different speeds and gravity loads to the cephalic position. Although differences were observed between the MHU- and - missions in the righting reflex test, the marginal differences in RNA-seq findings for the thymus and spleen were negligible compared with those in other gravity conditions. This research will serve as an animal test to elucidate the gravity threshold for each organ at the molecular level required to maintain  healthy state for future space travel. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms and further evaluating the gravitational threshold for each organ may offer strategies to maintain skeletal structure and immune systems in future space exploration.

    "text": "Although differences were observed between the MHU- and - missions in the righting reflex test, the marginal differences in RNA-seq findings for the thymus and spleen were negligible compared with those in other gravity conditions. This research will serve as an animal test to elucidate the gravity threshold for each organ at the molecular level required to maintain  healthy state for future space travel. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms and further evaluating the gravitational threshold for each organ may offer strategies to maintain skeletal structure and immune systems in future space exploration. Methods Mice C57BL/6J male mice (Stock #000664) were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) for the space experiments and Charles River Laboratories (Yokohama, Japan) for ground control experiments. All experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of JAXA (Protocol Number: 016-014B for MHU-, No. 018-011D for MHU-, and No. 018-036D for MHU-); Explora Biolabs (Study Number: EB15-010A for MHU-, No. EB19-003 for MHU-, and No. SP19-003 for MHU-); and NASA (Protocol Number: NAS-15-004-Y1 for MHU-, No. FLT-18-118 for MHU-, and No. JAXA MHU-/ FLT-19- 121 for MHU-). The experiments were conducted according to the guidelines and applicable laws in Japan and the United States of America and complied with the ARRIVE guidelines. MHU missions Figure 1A and Supplementary Fig. present an overview of the three MHU missions and two kinds of centrifuges, MARS- and MARS-. The detailed design of the three MHU missions has been previously published19. In all the MHU missions,  -week-old C57BL/6J male mice in  TCU were launched aboard the SpaceX Dragon space vehicle from the NASA KSC in Florida and then transported to the ISS. In the ISS, mice were Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:28774  |  www.nature.com/scientificreports/\n\ntransferred to the HCU, one mouse per cage, and then housed in  centrifuge under the conditions described below for 35, 25, and 26 days for MHU-, -, and -, respectively. MHU- mission: Twelve C57BL/6J male mice in the TCU were launched aboard SpX- on June 18, 2016, from the NASA KSC in Florida and then transported to the ISS. The mice were divided into two groups, AG and MG mice. The AG group was kept in an artificial   environment (  on the bottom floor of the HCU, at 77 rpm) in  MARS- centrifuge. MHU- mission: Six C57BL/6J male mice in the TCU were launched aboard SpX-17 on May , 2019, from the NASA KSC and then transported to the ISS. The PG- group was kept in an artificial /  environment (/  on the bottom floor of the HCU, at 31 rpm) in  MARS- centrifuge. MHU- mission: Six C57BL/6J male mice in the TCU were launched aboard SpX-20 on March 10, 2020, from the NASA KSC and then transported to the ISS. The PG- group was kept in an artificial /  environment Scientific Reports | (2024) 14:28774 10 |  www.nature.com/scientificreports/\n\n(/  on the bottom floor of the HCU, at 21 rpm) in  MARS- centrifuge. MARS- is approximately . times larger in diameter than MARS-, which decreases the gravity gradient, allowing for more precise gravity settings. Experiments on the GC group in each mission were conducted at the JAXA Laboratory in Japan  few months after the space experiments were completed. Six age-matched (- or -weeks old) male C57BL/6J mice per mission were used, and the time spent in the TCU or HCU was the same for each space experiment. Phenotypic analyses for all three missions were conducted by the same researchers. Unavoidably, it took approximately , ., and . days of transport time for MHU-, -, and -, respectively, after return to Earth for initiating the experimental analysis at Explora Biolabs. The return phase and animal dissection After unberthing from the ISS, the Dragon vehicle splashed down in the Pacific Ocean near California. After  ship picked up the cargo, the returned TCU was transported to  port in Long Beach (Supplementary Fig. ). JAXA later received the TCU from NASA and transported it to Explora Biolabs in San Diego for further analysis. The health conditions of the mice were checked and their body weights were measured. Subsequently, the mid- air righting reflex test was performed. Each mouse oriented in the supine position was dropped twice from  height of approximately 40 cm above the padded surface, and the average time for righting was analyzed using high-speed video (DSC-RX100M5, SONY, Tokyo, Japan). The rotarod performance test was performed after the righting reflex test. First, the mouse was placed on  rod rotating at  speed of  rpm to acclimate it, and the experiment began when the mouse was able to stay on the rod (47600, Bioresearch Center, Nagoya, Japan). The rotation speed of the rod was accelerated from  to 40 rpm in  min using  ramping acceleration mode. The time each mouse could stay on the rod was measured. For each mouse, the rotor test was performed three times, and the average of the last two tests was used as the data for each mouse. Isoflurane-anesthetized mice were euthanized using exsanguination and dissected to collect tissue samples. Samples that required cryopreservation were transported by air in  refrigerated box containing dry ice. The journey from the laboratory where the dissections were performed in the USA to JAXA  laboratory in Japan took several days in all instances (MHU-, . days; MHU-, . days; MHU-, . days), and temperature changes during that time were checked using temperature data loggers. Micro-computed tomography analysis After fixation with 70% ethanol, distal regions of the femur were analyzed. Micro-computed tomography scanning was performed using  ScanXmate-A100S Scanner (Comscantechno, Yokohama, Japan). Reconstructed three-dimensional microstructural image data were analyzed and all parameters were calculated according to previously published guidelines38 using TRI/3D-BON software (RATOC System Engineering, Co., Ltd, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, parameters of trabecular tissue volume (TV, mm3), trabecular bone volume (BV, mm3), trabecular bone thickness (Tb.Th,  ), trabecular bone number (Tb., /mm), trabecular bone separation (Tb.Sp,  ; intervals among trabecular bones), average thickness of cortical bone (Ct.Th,  ), and cross-sectional area of cortical bone (Ct.Ar, mm2) were measured directly based on the computed tomography images. percentage of the trabecular bone volume for the total tissue volume was calculated as BV/TV (%). Bone mineral content in the trabecular bone tissue (BMC/TV, mg/cm3) and bone mineral density in the cortical bone (BMD, mg/cm3) were measured with  bone mineral quantification phantom. Measurement of plasma TRAP and osteocalcin Plasma levels of TRAP and osteocalcin were measured with MouseTRAP  (TRAcP 5b) ELISA (Immunodiagnostic Systems, UK), and Mouse Gla-Osteocalcin High Sensitive EIA Kit (Takara Bio Inc, Shiga, Japan) according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. Isolation of bone tissues Bone tissues were prepared as previously described with modifications20. Connective tissues and the periosteum of femurs and tibiae were removed, and the bones were cut at the metaphyses. After bone marrow cells were removed from the diaphyses of femurs and tibiae by flushing with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), the bones were incubated with  mg/mL collagenase and  mg/mL dispase in alpha-minimum essential medium at 37   Fig. .

The remaining bone was used as an osteocyte- enriched bone. The bones were collected in TRIZOL reagent and ground into  powder using  tissue pulverizer (Minilys, Bertin Technologies, France) for total RNA extraction. RNA-sequencing analysis Total RNA was extracted from bone, spleen, and thymus using TRIZOL reagent according to the manufacturer  protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The RNA-seq library was prepared from 50 ng RNA using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep Kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) after rRNA depletion (NEB NEBNext rRNA Depletion Kit). Paired-end sequencing (   36 bases) was performed using NextSeq500 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Sequence reads were mapped to the mouse genome (mm10) using CLC Genomics Workbench (Version 10..; Qiagen, Redwood City, CA). Gene expression levels were calculated as the total read count normalized to transcripts per million. Genes with  counts in all samples and genes with total lead counts of  or less were excluded. Differential expression was analyzed using the Empirical Analysis of DGE tool (edgeR)39 in the CLC Main Workbench (CLC MW, Version 21..; Qiagen). Differentially expressed genes were extracted among the conditions (MHU-1_GC vs. MHU-1_MG, MHU-4_4GC vs. MHU-4_4PG, and MHU-5_5GC vs. MHU-5_5PG) with FDR-corrected  < .05. Gene functional analysis The clustering heatmap was generated in Morpheus ( GO analysis of each cluster was performed using the Enrichr webtool ( Histological and immunostaining of tissue sections For histological analysis, the spleen and thymus were fixed in % paraformaldehyde for 16  at    and embedded in paraffin. Paraffin sections of -  thickness were mounted on glass slides and subjected to HE staining. For immunohistochemical analysis, the spleen and thymus were snap-frozen in optimal cutting temperature compound (Sakura Finetek, Japan). Frozen sections of -  thickness were mounted on glass slides coated with amino silane. After fixing with ice-cold acetone for  min, sections were blocked with 10% goat serum in PBS and then treated with the following primary antibodies: anti-CD3e (BioLegend; 100236, :200), anti-CD45R (B220, BioLegend; 103228, :400), anti-TER119 (BioLegend; 116203, :300), anti-Keratin  (Krt5; Biolegend 905503, :500), and Alexa Flour 488-labeled anti-Keratin  (Krt8; Abcam ab192467, :50) antibodies, Alexa Flour 488-labeled anti-mouse Aire antibody (eBioscience; 53-5934-82, :500), and Biotin-labeled UEA-  (Vector laboratories; -1065-, :50) in PBS containing 10% goat serum for   at 24  , after washing, and further incubation with Alexa Fluor 546-labeled Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (Invitrogen; -11035, :500) Alexa Flour 546-labeled Streptavidin (Invitrogen; S11225, :500) for   at 24  , the sections were covered with glass coverslips using  mounting solution.

Abstract The International Space Station (ISS) National Laboratory is dedicated to studying the effects of space on life and physical systems, and to developing new science and technolo- gies for space exploration. key aspect of achieving these goals is to operate the ISS National Lab more like an Earth-based laboratory, conducting complex end-to-end experi- mentation, not limited to simple microgravity exposure. Towards that end NASA developed  novel suite of molecular biology laboratory tools, reagents, and methods, named WetLab- , uniquely designed to operate in microgravity, and to process biological samples for real- time gene expression analysis on-orbit. This includes  novel fluidic RNA Sample Prepara- tion Module and fluid transfer devices, all-in-one lyophilized PCR assays, centrifuge, and  real-time PCR thermal cycler. Here we describe the results from the WetLab- validation experiments conducted in microgravity during ISS increment 47/SPX-. Specifically, quanti- tative PCR was performed on  concentration series of DNA calibration standards, and Reverse Transcriptase-quantitative PCR was conducted on RNA extracted and purified on- orbit from frozen Escherichia coli and mouse liver tissue. Cycle threshold (Ct) values and PCR efficiencies obtained on-orbit from DNA standards were similar to Earth ( ) controls.

Funding: Funding for this research was provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration  International Space Station (ISS) Program at Johnson Space Center for development of  microgravity RT-qPCR analysis facility. The project was independently conducted by NASA Ames Research Center Space Biosciences and Engineering Systems Divisions. The NASA ISS\n\ntissue RNA samples was successfully conducted in about  , with data transmitted within   of experiment completion. Thermal cycling in microgravity resulted in the trapping of gas bubbles inside septa cap assay tubes, causing small but measurable increases in Ct curve noise and variability. Bubble formation was successfully suppressed in  rapid follow-up on- orbit experiment using standard caps to pressurize PCR tubes and reduce gas release dur- ing heating cycles. The WetLab- facility now provides  novel operational on-orbit research capability for molecular biology and demonstrates the feasibility of more complex wet bench experiments in the ISS National Lab environment. Introduction The ISS National Laboratory is  unique research environment whereby scientists from Acade- mia, Government, and Industry seek to learn the effects of space on life and matter in their many forms. Although  great deal has already been learned about the effects of microgravity on biological systems, [ ] the large majority of on-orbit experiments do not yield scientific data until long after return of samples to Earth for analysis, creating concerns about timeliness of data availability, and quality of sample preservation []. Ground analysis of on-orbit experi- ments has been necessary because of limited laboratory space, equipment, supplies, and astro- naut time resources on ISS, but while this sample return approach maximizes efficient access to space by scientists, it fails to teach us how to conduct end-to-end scientific inquiries in microgravity. As human exploration of the solar system proceeds, human missions to Mars and deep space will require greater levels of autonomy and resourcefulness as outlined in the National Research Council  Space Exploration Decadal Survey for Life and Physical Sciences [] An important component of future traveling and living in space away from low Earth orbit will be the ability to perform modern molecular biology analyses, including purifying RNA and conducting Reverse Transcriptase-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) or other genomic analy- ses for disease diagnostics including viral and bacterial infection, environmental microorgan- ism identification and monitoring of food and water, and in any other research application where monitoring gene expression is required. Although there are increasing numbers of studies of gene expression in microgravity, there are no reports of any methodologies for RNA purification and RT-qPCR under microgravity conditions, effectively preventing on-orbit analysis of gene expression or PCR-based diagnos- tics from biological samples. Specifically, recent RNA isolation and PCR-based gene expres- sion studies of biological samples on ISS, Space Shuttle and Biosatellites have been conducted on earth after preserved sample return from space [ 14]. Recent efforts by various groups of investigators have sought to develop portions of an overall genomic and molecular biology experimental capability on ISS. Specifically, these include the NASA Genes in Space , miniPCR student experiment, [15] and the  Biomolecular Sequencer  Nanopore DNA sequencing demonstration [16, 17] both conducted simultaneously with WetLab-. Both experiments however, started with genomic DNA samples, not indicative of gene expression, and relied either on sample return to earth for PCR product analysis, (miniPCR), or complex sequencing library preparation on earth prior to nanopore sequencing in space (Biomolecular Sequencer). Neither of these experiments had the end-to-end on-orbit capability to extract RNA from tissue, convert mRNA to cDNA for RT-qPCR, or to generate quantitative gene expression data as we sought to achieve with the WetLab- system. Novel system for RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analysis in microgravity PLOS ONE |  September , 2017  / 20 funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript. Competing interests: NASA provided both the funding and employs the majority of the authors that conducted this study, which may be perceived as  competing interest, however, the funding organization within NASA (ISS Program at Jonhson Space Center) is distinct from the performing organizations (Space Biosciences and Engineering Systems Divisions at NASA Ames Research Center), and the project leadership including the corresponding author (EACA) and project Managers (CSR and JS) are protected from funder influence by academic tenure-like civil service positions. In addition MB and RD are employed by Claremont Biosolutions and may benefit in their employment from the publication of their contributions. To address the pressing ISS research and diagnostics need for novel on-orbit end-to-end molecular biology gene expression analysis methods and tools, we devised  robust micrograv- ity fluidic system that can intake diverse biological sample (cells, tissue, surface swabs, blood, etc.) and using temperature-stable reagents, allow for the isolation and purification of nucleic acids, such as RNA, for molecular biology analysis. In addition, the system includes  micro- gravity compatible thermal cycler, lyophilized reagents and enzymes for PCR assays and meth- ods for reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA, and capabilities for heat inactivation of enzymes such as proteinase  and PCR inhibitors, plus RT-qPCR gene expression analysis using fluorescent TaqMan probes. The WetLab2 suite of instruments and reagents we describe here is novel and unique methodology, substantially distinct from all other existing RNA isola- tion and RT-qPCR gene expression analysis systems, because of its ability to function in micro- gravity, with altered fluid flow, hydrostatic pressure, convection, and surface tension conditions of space, while still providing full reagent containment for safe operation on ISS. Using this system, schematically shown in Fig , generic reagents and supplies can be preposi- tioned on ISS to flexibly support science opportunities such as optimizing plant growth, moni- toring the evolution of bacterial communities in biofilms, or analyzing gene expression in immune cells from blood, among many other applications. In addition, the WetLab- system was also designed to be capable of purifying RNAs for return to Earth, or for other on-orbit molecular biology analyses such as nanopore array-based mRNA sequencing studies, greatly increasing the analysis capabilities of the system and possibilities for discovery in space. In its validation flight, WetLab- successfully demonstrated its capabilities to conduct molecular biology experimentation in microgravity. This consisted of first demonstrating that qPCR functions in microgravity conditions, followed by demonstration of RNA isolation from bacterial cell and mammalian tissue and gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR. When gases evolved by thermal cycling accumulated in PCR tubes due to microgravity conditions inter- fered with data uniformity, the system demonstrated its flexibility and adaptability to on-orbit experiment modification and iteration in real-time. WetLab- also used volunteer astronaut time and spare supplies to design and execute follow-up experiments while on-orbit to resolve the gas bubble problem. Below we describe in detail the design and scientific validation of the WetLab- suite of methods, reagents, and hardware for RNA purification and gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR, enabling future molecular biology experimentation to be conducted end-to-end in real-time on ISS, and allowing data interpretation and experiment redesign while on-orbit. Materials and methods In order to validate the system,  number of ground-based and on-orbit tests were performed including: validation of . coli primer assays (ground), validation of lyophilized components (ground), validation of the SPM (ground), validation of all hardware (ground), validation of qPCR efficiency using pre-prepared assays (on-orbit), validation of RNA extracted from . coli (on-orbit), and from mouse liver tissue (on-orbit) using the SPM. The methods used in these validation experiments are described in detail below. Primer and probe design This study used three types of assays for different portions of the validation of the system. First, an . coli genomic assay was used to demonstrate if qPCR was possible in microgravity and that the data matched   controls. This was followed with  set of . coli gene expression assays designed to validate the sample prep and RT-qPCR capabilities of the system. Finally,  set of mouse gene expression assays were used to validate the system with  mammalian tissue.

For mouse assays, pre-designed intron spanning assays targeting genes for glyceraldehyde -phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) and 60S ribosomal protein L19 (rpl19) were used for normalization and fibronectin  (fn1) was used to measure gene expression anal- ysis. All primers and probes were produced by Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, Iowa). In all cases, TaqMan based technology was used [18]. The corresponding fluorescent dye and its primer and probe sequences are shown in Table . Assay formulation, preparation, and validation To validate the . coli genomic assay formulation, we analyzed qPCR performance using vary- ing quantities of template in tenfold dilutions between    and  pg (inclusive). Assays were constituted using high molecular weight genomic DNA from . coli type  cells (Affymetrix, Sunnyvale, CA), custom primers and probe targeting  16S ribosomal DNA sequence (IDT, Coralville, Iowa), GoTaq Probe Master Mix (Promega, Madison, WI), and molecular biology grade water (TekNova, Hollister, CA). Amplification was achieved via  standard thermal pro- tocol that included  hot-start activation step (95 ,  min) and 45 cycles of denaturation (95 , 15 ) and annealing/extension (54 , 60 ). Samples were run in duplicate technical rep- licates and their average Ct values were plotted against template concentration to determine -square and efficiency of amplification. Products were confirmed using  Bioanalyzer 2100 and an Agilent DNA chip, using  DNA 1000 protocol and reagent.

Initial feasibility studies how- ever utilized mouse liver tissues obtained under NASA Ames Research Center IACUC proto- cols NAS-14-002-Yr1- and NAS-15-008-Y1- (. Almeida and . Blaber). RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and tested to have  RNA Integrity Number (RIN) greater than . using  Bioanalyzer 2100 and RNA 6000 Pico Chip. Each assay was vali- dated using the appropriate RNA template in  RT-qPCR cocktail. Singleplex, duplex and tri- plex reactions were validated for each organism. Amplification was achieved via  single step RT-qPCR thermal protocol that includes  Reverse Transcription (45 , 15 min), hot-start activation step (95 ,  min) and 45 cycles of denaturation (95 , 15 ) and annealing/exten- sion (54 , 60 ), further detailed online at protocols.io [19]. Lyophilized assay validation After successful validation of assay performance, all assay formulations were purchased as lyophilized sample-ready products in the Reaction Tubes (BioGX, Birmingham, AL). The pro- tocol for lyophilized assay generation is detailed in online at protocols.io [20]. To test the per- formance of the lyophilized assays, Ct values of lyophilized assays were compared to those of non-lyophilized controls. For the . coli genomic assay three concentrations of template; high (100 ng), mid ( ng), and low (10 pg), along with no template controls (NTC), were run for each group. Non-lyophilized controls were constituted as described above while lyophilized assays were re-hydrated with elution buffer (Claremont BioSolutions, Upland, CA). Lyophi- lized . coli and mouse liver gene expression assays were tested by running singleplex, duplex, and triplex reactions. Individual, average, and standard deviation of Ct values were compared to corresponding controls, within template groups. Two individual lots were tested against  single benchtop control lot. BioGX also carried out independent validation of the lyophilized products. Microgravity compatible RNA extraction procedure RNA isolation was performed utilizing an alcohol-free version of the RNA binding buffer and washes for Claremont BioSolutions  commercially available OmniLyse1 [21, 22] and their RNAexpress column. The process was carried out in  SPM, an enclosed microgravity-com- patible hardware module designed to require only simple manual manipulations that can be performed by an untrained user. The SPM contains syringes preloaded with wash and elution buffers and has an input port with  Luer-Lok1 connection for the incoming Sample Transfer Tool (STT). The procedure consists of lysing the sample with the battery powered OmniLyse1 and binding of RNA to the RNAexpress column. This is followed by two washes of the col- umn with Claremont BioSolutions wash buffer in preloaded syringes. The RNA is then eluted into  removable syringe using the Claremont BioSolutions elution buffer. To test the SPM performance, 100 million . coli cells or  mg of mouse liver tissue were used for RNA extraction. Resulting RNA quantity and quality were assessed using  NanoDrop 20001 (Thermofisher, Waltham, MD) and  Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA), respectively. The SPM-derived RNA was also used as the template in RT-qPCR reactions pre- pared as stated above. Hardware testing To determine the compatibility of hardware components, reagents were stored in hardware for long duration testing and were assessed for compatibility with downstream molecular biol- ogy applications (.. qPCR, RNA Isolation, and RT-qPCR). Novel system for RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analysis in microgravity PLOS ONE |  September , 2017  /\n\nACT2s (specialty microgravity compatible transfer hardware, Techshot, Greenville, IN) and Finger Loop syringes (BD, Franklin Lakes, NJ) were loaded and stored at -80 . Units were removed from the freezer at designated time points, allowed to thaw at ambient temperature (at least   for the ACT2 and 45 min for the Finger Loop syringe), then RNA was extracted using the SPM procedure described above. To test the SPMs for reagent compatibility, SPMs were assembled with the syringes preloaded with wash and elution buffers and stored at ambi- ent temperatures. At designated time points, SPMs were used to isolate fresh samples of either 1x108 . coli cells or  mg of mouse liver tissue. For all hardware tests, RNA quantity and qual- ity were assessed as described previously. RT-qPCR using sample specific primers and probe were also used to test RNA quality as described previously. Reaction Tubes containing lyophilized . coli and mouse gene expression assays, master mixes and enzymes were packaged at BioGX ( tubes per sealed pouch) and stored at   until tested. All lyophilized mixes were tested at designated time points and utilized 25 ng of . coli or mouse Qiagen RNeasy purified RNA (as appropriate) in 25   of molecular biology grade water to rehydrate the assays. Amplification conditions used were described above. In all cases, results were compared to those from the  =  time point. The thermocycler to be flown to the ISS was also validated prior to use. Details of all hardware testing results are shown in the S2 Text. On-orbit quantitative PCR analyses Microgravity data generated in this study were attained from on-orbit operations onboard the ISS. All materials, hardware, and biology were transported during the SpaceX CRS- cargo resupply mission that launched to the ISS on April 8th, 2016 and experiments were conducted on April 19th, 22nd, 26th, 29th and May 2nd. Operations required the use of the WetLab- hard- ware suite consisting of microgravity-compatible STT (ACT2 or Finger Loop syringe), SPM, bubble-removing Pipette Loader (PL), reaction tube centrifugation rotor and  Cepheid SmartCycler1 for thermocycling/fluorescence readout, as described in S1 Text. control data were generated using identical protocols and hardware within 12  of completion of ISS operations. The on-orbit operations consisted of three types of tests. First, the efficiency of qPCR in microgravity using pre-prepared reaction mixtures including . coli genomic DNA was tested three times. Second, isolation of RNA on-orbit using the SPM and pre-frozen . coli cells followed by analysis of gene expression was tested followed by testing of RNA isolation from mammalian tissue using the SPM and pre-frozen mouse liver tissue followed by analysis of gene expression. For each experiment, one ISS and one ground kit were removed from their respective cold stowage (both   and -80  if applicable) and allowed to equilibrate at room temperature for   . For ISS operations, experiments were performed within  RNase-free and cleaned Dis- posable Glove Bag (DGB) to prevent contamination. At the start of ISS operations, session materials contained in RNase-free bags were placed into the DGB and wiped with RNase AWAY wipes (Molecular BioProducts , Waltham, MA). The   control experiment was con- ducted in  standard molecular biology laboratory; all work surfaces were cleaned using RNase AWAY wipes and 70% ethanol. Data from the ISS experiments were downlinked within   of completion of the clean-up activity and results were statistically compared with those from corresponding   controls.",

Comparisons made between micro- gravity and   control data, or between lyophilized and benchtop control assays across differ- ent template concentrations were evaluated using ANOVA or Student  -test as appropriate.

Results qPCR in microgravity Assay design and testing. In order to assess the functionality of PCR in microgravity con- ditions and to establish the dynamic range and efficiency of amplification, we designed  robust quality control qPCR assay to measure these parameters. We targeted  16S ribosomal region of genomic . coli DNA. The abundant target expression improved precision, sensitiv- ity, and reproducibility, providing robust assay conditions. Validation of the . coli genomic DNA assay was performed using  standard thermal cycling protocol with controlled quantities of commercially available . coli DNA as template. Assays were tested with template quantities between  pg and   , in duplicates (Fig 2A), and evaluated based on amplification plot characteristics and reaction efficiency. Results show that assays successfully generated amplification products, as detected by qPCR, with fluorescence peaks between 300 and 600 units. Assay efficiency was determined to be at 96.% with an R2 greater than .99 (Fig 2A inset). Specificity and accuracy was confirmed by gel band migration analysis, with the product amplicon generating bands of the expected molecular size. In order to minimize crew time and the need for refrigeration resources, pre-formulated reagents were lyophilized in the Cepheid SmartTube detection window. To validate that the lyophilized assay format and lyophilization process did not compromise assay performance [23], we tested the lyophilized products by assessing qPCR performance in comparison to commercial non-lyophilized reagents (control). This was performed using high, mid and low template concentrations and  NTC. Combined data between two lots of lyophilized product show that lyophilized assays were able to consistently generate Ct values similar to those gener- ated by non-lyophilized controls (see Table ). Microgravity qPCR runs. Following transport to the ISS and an initial software and instrument setup, the system was tested with three runs of the . coli genomic DNA assay. Data from the first run is shown in Fig 2B and has  typical qPCR amplification curve, although an unusual amount of noise was observed in microgravity samples especially in later cycles. Furthermore, when the default SmartCycler software values were used, outliers were observed resulting in high standard deviations between replicate samples. These outliers did not impair the clustering of the on-orbit data with the respective DNA concentrations. Data from  second run was similar to the first but  third repeat run did not yield results due to tube dispensing errors attributed to  PL malfunction. Post-run photos of the tubes showed that no liquid was transferred into most of the tubes. Noise in the curves was attributed to degassing bubble formation in the tube detection win- dows during thermal cycling [24 26], as confirmed by post-run photos of the tubes. Photos of all tubes were taken before and after thermal protocol completion, the inset in Fig 2B shows pre- and post-run photos of  representative tube for reference. The pre and post photos of the tubes reveal significant bubble formation and microgravity-trapping during the heating cycles of the qPCR reaction. The bubbles were likely caused by degassing during thermocycling [26] and their evolution and trapping may cause noise in fluorescence intensity detection.

All statistical comparisons for this study used this data. Microgravity and   control data comparisons. Shortly after the completion of each of the on-orbit operations,    control run was performed. Care was taken to match the removal time of the lyophilized assays from   to the start of operations. Fig 2C 2F shows side-by- side comparisons of microgravity runs and their matched   controls. Amplification curves from the corresponding   control runs were smooth and similar to those obtained during previous testing. Non-specific amplification, as observed from the NTC tubes (black lines), were seen on both microgravity and   control graphs. Given that the target gene is  16S rRNA, non-specific amplification in the NTC samples may be seen when Taq polymerase is bacteria-derived [27] or due to primer derived artifacts. Microgravity fluorescence intensity values also show  lower overall amplitude potentially due to bubbles blocking/reducing some of the collected fluorescence signal [24 26]. Raw background fluorescence data between microgravity and   control were also compared and details can be found in the S1 File. Comparison of microgravity and   control Ct values revealed that despite the noise and reduced intensity in microgravity samples, the Ct values still appear to be comparable to   control results as seen in Fig 2G & 2H and in S1 Table. Efficiency plots for the microgravity and   control samples (Fig 2C 2F insets) were gener- ated with Ct values using  Boxcar averaging of  and otherwise default software settings. The efficiency for the   control data was 105.% for run  and 102.% for run  and the linear standard curve R2 = .9971 and .9985 respectively and microgravity data was 104.% and 108.% and R2 = .9620 and .9865 respectively.

Table  shows the results from the triplex assays, results generated by the singleplex and duplex assays yielded similar results. ANOVA analyses of these results showed no statistical variation between lyophilized assays and their non-lyophilized controls, therefore indicating that lyophilized assays were suitable for use on ISS. SPM design and testing. An enclosed, simple RNA extraction procedure not requiring toxic chemicalsthat may complicate operation on ISS, was adapted (by removing alcohol) from commercially available Claremont BioSolutions products (Fig 3A). The resulting SPM was tested to ensure that the RNA yield was of sufficient quantity and quality for RT-qPCR [30]. Following optimization, RNA yields from the SPM were  10   for   108 . coli and . for  mg mouse liver. The RNA quality was adequate with RINs of . . for . coli and . . for mouse liver. Fig 3B shows typical SPM extracted RNA quality at   for both . coli and mouse liver. Ct values from RT-qPCR runs using RNA isolated from the SPM were also similar to results from Qiagen purified RNA. Residual . coli RNA purified in micrograv- ity was returned to Earth on SpaceX CRS- for Bioanalyzer testing. The RNA extracted in microgravity (RIN .) was compared to that of RNA extracted at   on the same day (RIN ) and is of comparable quality (Fig 3B) showing that RNA was successfully purified on the ISS. . coli RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analyses. After confirming that qPCR in micrograv- ity was possible and with results comparable to   controls, we proceeded to test the capability of the hardware system to isolate and process samples in microgravity. An . coli sample, used to test the system  capabilities with prokaryotic cells, was processed and analyzed on ISS as described previously. The RT-qPCR assays tested included singleplex (Fig 3C), duplex (Fig 3D), and triplex (Fig 3E) reactions (S1 Table), each performed in quadruplicate to improve sta- tistical sampling. All microgravity and   control reactions resulted in readable Ct data. In agreement with previous results, microgravity Ct values exhibited increased variability com- pared to   controls. Despite the greater variability observed in microgravity Ct values, no sta- tistically significant difference was found between the microgravity and   control data. One outlier was identified in the microgravity data and was not used in statistical comparisons. Also, one microgravity triplex tube did not give data in the FAM channel (dnaK).

These results indicate that RNA was successfully isolated from mouse liver tissue during spaceflight. Singleplex and duplex assays of the reference genes gapdh and rpl19 showed no statistical differences between microgravity and   control. However, in spaceflight, no gapdh-FAM sig- nal was observed during triplex assays whilst   control triplex assays resulted in detection of all three genes. Repeat run of . coli RNA isolation and bubble mitigation Following the completion of on-orbit activities, an opportunity arose several months later to test bubble formation mitigation strategies while repeating the . coli isolation activity. To test this, half of the modified reaction tube septa caps were replaced with standard SmartTube caps. However, the age of the sample preparation reagents was past the latest longevity testing duration and this test resulted in compromised Ct values in the FAM and Cy5 channels. The HEX channel appeared to be unaffected as seen in Fig . reduction in noise was observed with the use of standard caps (Fig 4B) as compared to the typical noise seen when septa caps are used (Fig 4A). Additionally, photos taken of the tubes after completion of the RT-qPCR run show an increase in the number of bubbles in the septa capped tubes as compared to those Fig .

We hypothesize that the internal tube pressure created when inserting the standard caps helps mitigate bubble formation. This was corroborated by sideways and inverted (upside down) ground thermocycling experiments that also trapped bubbles. Discussion One of the major obstacles to space exploration going forward in the coming decades is the fact that microgravity research outposts such as ISS are so closely dependent on Earth support of everyday activities, and lack the ability to operate autonomously. The National Academies of Sciences in their Decadal Survey [] have identified some of these limitations as important concerns and offered direction that the ISS should operate more like Earth-based laboratories, allowing for experiments to be designed, conducted, modified and iterated in space. Despite the thousands of investigations already conducted on ISS [31], there are still overwhelming limitations [32, 33] that prevent science and specifically molecular biology measurements of gene expression from being conducted and analyzed on-orbit. From its inception, the NASA WetLab- project has sought to address these concerns by introducing new, time-efficient, practical and flexible molecular biology gene expression anal- ysis capabilities to the ISS. The WetLab- hardware system can now rapidly perform RNA iso- lation on-orbit and use those RNAs to immediately conduct RT-qPCR analyses, or other novel analyses such as nanopore-based RNA sequencing. The utility of WetLab- can be applied to many molecular biology experimental designs using  variety of sample types and provides investigators with improved insight and interactivity during experimentation. Overall, the on- orbit process of total RNA isolation and gene expression analysis is accomplished in  span of approximately   without the requirement for  highly experienced user and provides  new capability to ISS that will greatly expand the limits of possible on-orbit science.

Novel system for RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analysis in microgravity PLOS ONE |  September , 2017 14 /\n\nSuccessful development and deployment of the WetLab- system to the ISS depended on solving  number of challenges such as limited refrigeration availability, hazardous reagent use allowances, power consumption, and availability of crew time. In addition, the suite of hard- ware and fluidic components had to function in microgravity and provide ease of use for non- expert operators. In order to perform thermal cycling on-orbit,  suitable, commercially available thermal cycler that was capable of operating in  microgravity environment was identified. Specifically, the Cepheid SmartCycler best met the requirements without significant modifications. The instrument is modular, has reduced power requirements and offers assay wells with individual thermal protocol programming allowing for simultaneous running of assays with different optimal primer annealing temperatures. Validation testing of this instrument included physi- cal durability tests and validation of all 16 sample sites. TaqMan assays were selected because of the ability to multiplex assays with multiple color probes in  single tube, and because alternatives such as SYBRGreen DNA intercalating dyes are carcinogenic, resulting in safety concerns for the ISS crew and imposing elevated contain- ment requirements. Next we developed  RNA isolation and RT-qPCR workflow using non-hazardous reagents suitable for room temperature storage. RNA binding column and cell lysis system for RNA purification was selected from Claremont BioSolutions for its ease of integration [21, 22]. In collaboration with Claremont, the RNA extraction protocol was modified to meet room tem- perature storage and low toxicity requirements. RNA extracted from the SPM proved to be of sufficient high quality and quantity for gene expression studies utilizing RT-qPCR (Fig 3B).

RNA extracted from the SPM proved to be of sufficient high quality and quantity for gene expression studies utilizing RT-qPCR (Fig 3B). Longevity testing of loaded SPMs showed no degradation of the reagents for at least 26 weeks (S2 Text). We proceeded to develop  lyophilized all-in-one detection assay to minimize crew time and storage requirements. Lacking instruments to evaluate RNA purity and potential gDNA contamination, intron-spanning primers that give  product approximately 100 bases in length were used in eukaryotic samples. In prokaryotic samples, DNase enzyme [34] was included due to the lack of introns in the coding region [35]. To ensure that lyophilized assays provided similar results to those obtained using wet bench chemistry, we performed extensive validation testing. Our results indicate no significant differences between lyophilized and commercial non-lyophilized assays (see Table ). When refrigerated, the lyophilized assays were stable with  shelf life of at least 52 weeks (S2 Text). To provide longer shelf life and room temperature storage conditions in the future, we plan to use the standard commercial caps, as they appear to perform better in initial results from ongoing long-term storage tests. Before the WetLab- system could be made available to researchers, the system was vali- dated to ensure that the data obtained on-orbit was not affected or biased by microgravity con- ditions, including surface tension-dominated fluid dynamics and lack of convection [36]. Specifically, because PCR consists of repeated cycles of rapid heating and cooling, lack of grav- ity-induced convection mixing in microgravity may limit heat transfer throughout the sample to only conduction which may require longer denaturation and annealing/extension times. To validate PCR efficiency in microgravity, control qPCR reactions were conducted once the system was installed on-orbit. These tests included validation with  range of pre-prepared DNA template concentrations (low, mid and high) to assess PCR efficiency. Three replicate runs were conducted, of which two were successful in returning qPCR amplification curves that showed close correlation to   controls. Furthermore, the microgravity Ct results were comparable to their respective   controls (Fig  and S1 Table). Although amplification was successful, microgravity data showed increased variability within replicate sets. Analysis of the amplification plots, post-assay tube windows, and follow up experiments suggest that this Novel system for RNA isolation and RT-qPCR analysis in microgravity PLOS ONE |  September , 2017 15 /\n\nincreased variability may be caused by degassing bubble formation that interferes with fluores- cence detection. In subsequent ground-based experiments, we found that these bubbles rise out of the tube detection window under normal   conditions. Conversely, in microgravity, bubbles form, are retained and expand in the tube optical window during thermocycling, cre- ating noise (choppiness) in the resulting amplification curves. Despite higher variability when using septa caps, our data show that qPCR can be conducted in the SmartCycler using TaqMan assays in microgravity conditions, and that resulting Ct values are comparable to those of   controls, albeit noisier (Fig 2G & 2H). These results indicate that the physical alterations of fluid and thermal dynamics in microgravity are not sufficient to alter enzymatic amplification of DNA during PCR thermal cycling in the SmartCycler. To validate that the WetLab- system could successfully isolate RNA from intact cells and tissue, as well as perform RT-qPCR analyses on-orbit, we prepared and froze samples of . coli and mouse liver tissue on the ground. Results show that RNA was successfully isolated on- orbit using the SPM and that singleplex and multiplex RT-qPCR analyses from both . coli cells and mouse liver tissues resulted in successful qPCR amplification (Fig  and S1 Table). Successful multiplex RT-qPCR allows for the use of ratiometric methods; expression of genes of interest can be measured relative to reference genes in the same tube, thereby effectively normalizing variability that may exist in RNA concentrations or other artifacts of microgravity PCR amplification. Comparison of raw background fluorescence data showed significant differences between microgravity and   control samples (S1 File), however, no significant differences in Ct values. In agreement with genomic DNA standards data, increased variability was also observed in the microgravity samples using SPM-derived . coli and mouse RNA, likely due to bubble forma- tion during thermal cycling. As this variability in Ct values may limit the utility of the system for researchers,  follow up  volunteer science  experiment was conducted by astronaut Kate Rubins. This test was aimed at reducing or eliminating bubbles formed during thermal cycling and showed that the positive pressure formed in the tubes when closed using  standard cap drastically reduces bubbles and results in smooth amplification curves similar to those typically seen during RT-qPCR runs in   (Fig ). This run yielded data with less variability; standard deviations up to .659 Ct for standard caps compared to .035 Ct for septa caps. Therefore, for future experiments, we intend to use standard commercial tubes to suppress degassing bubble formation. Through these experiments, we have demonstrated that qPCR can be successfully per- formed in the microgravity environment of space and developed an system of molecular biol- ogy tools and reagents for extracting and quantitatively analyzing RNA from biological samples on-orbit and generating RT-qPCR Ct data (See photos of actual on-orbit operations in Fig ). In conclusion, the WetLab- ISS system is now validated and ready for future end-to-end gene expression analysis on-orbit, providing prompt results and data reporting from multiple cell and tissue biological samples. This new capability allows investigators unprecedented flexi- bility with ISS research and the opportunity to re-design and iterate experiments based on data received in almost real-time. The WetLab2 system is publicly available to investigators for research on ISS [37] and can also potentially be used to analyze environmental samples, for medical diagnostics, or to provide purified RNA and cDNAs for expressome sequencing and global gene expression analysis using nanopore sequencing [17] as our group recently demon- strated [38]. Overall the novel molecular biology capabilities we describe here for for ISS, although trivial on earth, are an important step forward in the quest for making possible the exploration and development of space for human use.

(Lyndon  Johnson, Vice President, Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing, January 1959) This report provides  long-term perspective on possible space futures to inform strategic decision- making. Economic, political, technological, and military space trends indicate that we have passed the tipping point for space as  vastly increased domain of human endeavor and  key element of national power. Other countries recognize the advantages of .. space leadership, as well as the value space capabilities provide, and are moving aggressively to challenge the .. To ensure continued .. space leadership,  coordinated, short-, mid-, and long-term national strategy is required. Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) hosted  Space Futures Workshop (SFW) to explore the role of space to the year 2060. Participants from the DoD, NASA, NATO, industry, and academia used an alternative futures analysis technique to develop  range of future scenarios and to explore how they relate to national power. Eight future space scenarios were developed and explored along civil, commercial, and military conditions by defining positive and negative bounds. These bounds were developed based upon an analysis of technical, value, and national interest trends and assumptions as to the overall economic, political, and military state of the world in 2060. Key conclusions reached were:   The .. must recognize that in 2060, space will be  major engine of national political, economic, and military power for whichever nations best organize and operate to exploit that potential. The .. faces growing competition from allies, rivals, and adversaries for leadership in the exploration and exploitation of space. China is executing  long-term civil, commercial, and military strategy to explore and economically develop the cislunar domain with the explicit aim of displacing the .. as the leading space power. Other nations are developing similar national strategies. failure to remain  leading space power will place .. national power at risk. To avert this, the .. coalition must promote and optimize the combined civil, military, and commercial exploitation of space to best serves the nation  interests. The .. military must define and execute its role in promoting, exploiting, and defending the expanded military, civil, and commercial .. activities and human presence in space. The workshop produced the following recommendations:   The US must develop  long-term, national space strategy to ensure continued leadership. This strategy should be developed across government, industry, and academia to ensure synergy of efforts to optimize and promote overall .. national space power and grand strategy. DISTRIBUTION . Approved for public release   AFSPC should commit the resources to complete the strategy as outlined in this report as  part of its organize, train, and equip mission. .. Space Command should similarly commit resources to this effort as part of their strategic and operational execution missions. The strategy must address how the national security establishment will defend the full range of expanded national interests in space (.., civil and commercial space capabilities and citizens in space) - not just the services that directly support national security. Essential capabilities and technologies to enable positive future outcomes must be developed by the whole of government. An investment, policy, and regulatory strategy must be pursued to ensure those capabilities. The nation must commit to investment in science and technology to drive the rapidly changing global space environment as  key element of the strategy. This report presents results from the first step in  three-step effort to support the development of this strategy. The three steps are: ) Describe  range of possible future scenarios and explore the characteristics of those scenarios across civil, economic, and military realms and their implications for national power. ) Determine  national strategy vision across these futures that promote those most advantageous to the .., and avoid those most disadvantageous, particularly with respect to national defense. ) Determine the minimum essential capabilities and actions required to implement that strategy, with emphasis on the military role. Next steps in this process will develop additional recommendations required to promote space futures advantageous to the .. Additionally,  minimum set of actions required by the .. space community to affect national strategy will be determined, with emphasis on the military role in that strategy. Subsequent follow-on work will include specific recommendations on science and technology focus areas and investments to ensure the .. is well placed to deter threats and maintain space leadership. DISTRIBUTION . Approved for public release . Introduction  We don  know exactly when the human sphere of influence will expand to the Moon and Mars, but we do know it will happen. (Major General Shaw, Deputy Commander, AFSPC) An examination of the convergence of economic, political, technological, and military space trends indicates we have passed the tipping point to futures with space as  vastly increased domain of human endeavor and  key element of national power. There is clear evidence of this emerging, new era for space:   National leadership  acknowledgement that space is  warfighting domain and the consequent stand-up of the United States Space Command as  new geographic combatant command. The Vice President  tasking to NASA for  crewed mission to the Moon by 2024. China  development and implementation of  national strategy for space dominance. The continuing growth in the number of space faring nations and in their space capabilities. The rapid growth in  New Space  leading to expanding commercial endeavors to develop innovative space capabilities. The global explosion of space system and launch innovations driving the proliferation of lower- cost systems, and the beginning of space tourism. For the last half century, the United States has been the dominant space power across the military, intelligence, science, exploration, and commercial domains. Other countries recognize the advantages of .. space leadership, as well as the value space capabilities provide, and are moving aggressively to challenge the .. To ensure continued .. space leadership,  coordinated, short-, mid-, and long-term national strategy is required. This strategy must be driven by  clear understanding of potential long-term space futures both favorable and unfavorable to the .., and of the drivers for those futures. This report presents results from the first step in  three-step effort to support the development of this strategy. The three steps are: . Describe  range of possible future scenarios and explore the characteristics of those scenarios across civil, economic, and military realms and their implications for national power. . Determine  national strategic vision across these futures that promote those most advantageous to the .., and avoid those most disadvantageous, particularly with respect to national defense. . Determine the minimum essential capabilities and actions required to implement that strategy, with emphasis on the military role. To address the first step, the Air Force Space Command (AFPSC) hosted  Space Futures Workshop (SFW) to explore space futures. In attendance were subject matter experts across the DoD, as well as from NASA, NATO, industry, and academia (see Annex ). This report documents the workshop  processes, results, conclusions, and recommendations. An alternative futures analysis technique developed by Shell Oil Company was used. This technique develops and explores  range of scenarios which, while not explicitly predictive, illuminates the spectrum of possible futures, and how they relate to national power. Such scenario-based thinking is  powerful means to consider and clarify multiple perspectives on the future and to identify potential inflection points and drivers for the future. [-] The methodology is described in detail in Annex . DISTRIBUTION . Approved for public release This inaugural workshop focused on the challenges from peer rival China. Though focused on  single rival, these alternate futures align with those developed in the Air Force Strategic Environmental Assessment (AFSEA) 2016-2046. [] From this scenario-based process, the workshop developed and examined eight future scenarios across the following axes:   Human Presence: How broadly and in what numbers do humans live and work in space? Commercial Potential: What is the economic level of new, persistent revenue from space activities? Leadership: To what degree do the .. coalition lead in the creation of the civil, commercial, and military space capabilities and in establishing the norms, standards, and international regulations in space? (.., based on free world concepts of  liberal international order?) The civil, commercial, and military characteristics of each future scenario was then explored (see Chapter ). Based upon examination of those futures scenarios, we drew initial conclusions and recommendations (See Chapters  and ). . Boundary Conditions and Future Scenarios  Prediction is very difficult; especially about the future. (Neils Bohr, Nobel Prize winner in Physics) Eight scenarios, or alternative futures to 2060, were derived by defining realistic bounds as to the minimum and maximum developments along three axes of space power: human presence in space, economic importance of space, and .. coalition leadership in space. For this analysis we assumed that the states along each axis are independent of those along the other axes. The upper and lower bounds of each axis are summarized below. The bounds are derived from the SFW brainstorming activities informed by the assumptions as to the global state and the extrapolation of current space trends to 2060. Annex  and  contain detailed information of these trends and assumptions, especially relating to China  space program. The methodology used to determine future scenarios is presented in Annex .

DISTRIBUTION . Approved for public release Star Trek: Most optimistic and expansive The .. coalition retains leadership over the space domain and has introduced free-world laws and processes that have led to significant global civil, commercial, and military expansion in space and resulted in large revenue streams.

Garden Earth: Optimistic and expansive The .. coalition retains leadership over the space domain and has introduced free-world laws and processes that have led to significant global civil, commercial, and military expansion in space and resulted in large revenue streams. However, human presence is limited and most processes are controlled remotely or robotically. Elysium: Optimistic and expansive The .. coalition retains leadership over the space domain and has introduced free-world laws and processes that have led to significant global civil, commercial, and military expansion in space. Thousands of humans live or work in space at  variety of habitats across cislunar space, the Moon, and Mars. However, large revenue streams have yet to materialize. Commercial activity is focused in LEO to GEO terrestrial communications, information, PNT, and to provide key parts of the civil and commercial infrastructure required for the continued expansion of human presence in space. Key Resulting Military, Civil, and Commercial Characteristics Military   The . coalition is the lead military space power. Other space faring nations continuously challenge that lead through expansion of their own capabilities or through alliances with other space faring nations. The . coalition has the range of military capabilities necessary to:  Protect the critical elements of their extensive civil, commercial, and human presence across cislunar space from conventional and cyber threats. Protect the combined commercial, civil, and military command, control, communications, computer, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C4ISR) infrastructure to monitor and control space operations and provide information services in, through, and from the cislunar environment during peace and conflict. Project military power throughout the cislunar environment to exercise selected space superiority in time and place as needed for conflicts within space and as part of larger, cross- domain conflicts. Preempt any other nations monopolizing key logistics points (lunar poles, Lagrangian points, etc.) or key assets (asteroids, lunar water, etc.) for military uses. Space military power is widely distributed across space faring nations with the preponderance not controlled by the US coalition. The US coalition  technological and operational lead is continually challenges by shifting alliances and increased capabilities of potential adversaries. Civil   The . coalition successfully leads to establish civil norms of behavior, rules, and laws for space that support their beliefs and interests (free and open markets, open access and transit, etc.). The . coalition promotes and leads in multinational development of critical infrastructure (communication, situational awareness, collision avoidance, etc.) while developing independent infrastructure required to ensure national interests during peace and conflict. There is limited ability to accomplish civil goals unilaterally. Power is distributed among many space faring nations and entities with  wide range of space capabilities and interests.

The US coalition leads in space explorations with international outposts and colonies on the moon, an outpost on Mars, and asteroid exploration. Other major space faring nations and alliances have competing, commensurate, civil-focused, exploration programs. Commercial   The size of the space economy has increased greatly, more so in  Star Trek  and  Garden Earth  but still substantial in  Elysium. Commercial space capabilities provide the preponderance of raw materials and manufactured products to further expand space capabilities. The . coalition is the lead commercial space power and attracts  disproportionate fraction of global space investment, but the preponderance of commercial capability is distributed across many nations and entities, with China, India, US, the EU, Russia, Japan, and Brazil as first-tier commercial space powers. US coalition  leadership is continuously challenged by other first-tier, commercial players and by the continued proliferation of space commerce across nations and multinational companies. Multiple nations have moon bases or colonies competing with the .. coalition in providing key infrastructure for commercial exploitation of the moon and continued development of manufacturing and facilities across cislunar space. . Negative Futures: Zheng He, Wild Frontier, and Xi  Dream These three future scenarios posit  major growth in the importance of space and share the characteristic of an alternate to  .. coalition as the leader across the civil, commercial, and military elements of space power. They further posit  significant power advantage of this lead space power over the .. and its allies. While who might develop to be this leading space power is uncertain, we have chosen names with  Chinese reference since China is presently the most likely candidate. In these futures, the alternate lead space power views the .. coalition as  rival at best and  potential adversary at worst. Zheng He: Expansive but most pessimistic An alternate nation exercises leadership over the space domain and has introduced laws and processes that promote their interests or limit the actions of rivals. Leveraging their growing technological edge and by using non-competitive practices, they attract  growing, disproportionate share of global space revenue streams. Thousands of humans live in space to maintain lunar and Mars bases to promote national prestige, further patterns of dependency, and support the technology and infrastructure for commercial and military space leadership. Wild Frontier: Expansive but pessimistic No clear space power exercises leadership over the space domain. However, the growth in space capabilities of national and private entities has resulted in global civil, commercial, and military expansion in space and led to large revenue streams. However, human presence is limited, driven primarily by national prestige, exploration, and tourism. 11 DISTRIBUTION . Approved for public release Xi  Dream: Expansive but pessimistic An alternate nation is the lead space power, though the importance of space is driven by the increased human presence in space for exploration, tourism, and to support and maintain commercial space capabilities. Large revenue streams have yet to materialize. Commercial activity is focused in LEO to GEO terrestrial communications, information, PNT, and to provide key parts of the civil and commercial infrastructure required for the continued expansion of human presence in space. Key Resulting Military, Civil, and Commercial Characteristics Military   The alternate chief space nation and its allies lead in military space power and has the range of military capabilities necessary to:  Defend the critical elements of their civil, commercial, military, and human space assets, as well as  C4ISR to monitor and control space operations and provide information services in, through, and from the cislunar environment during peace and conflict.

Commercial   While the preponderance of commercial power is distributed across  number of nations with the US coalition having  significant space commercial presence, the alternate, chief space power has  large and growing technological and market-share advantage over all other space-faring nations that attracts  disproportionate share of global commercial space investments. They have  significant advantage in scale and pricing for space structures (satellites, habitats, etc.), power, and low-cost and flexible launch. They lead in space resource extraction to meet critical space and terrestrial needs for raw materials providing them commercial and political leverage. They have de facto control over key locations in space (Lagrangian points, etc.) and on the Moon (polar region, space elevator lunar point, key mineral deposits, etc.). They have  commercial space enterprise increasingly independent of systems and elements produced on Earth. They use non-competitive practices to maintain and extend their lead position with limited capability by the US coalition or other nations to counter these practices. They limit these actions as required to avoid encouraging alliances to oppose them. The US subsidizes US space industries supporting critical national needs where supply by the lead space power or its allies pose unacceptable risks. . Military Dominance Futures: Space Today and Dark Skies These futures take the lower bound for human presence and the space economy. In these futures, human presence is primarily limited to government-supported space exploration and commercially to information services, communication, and PNT between LEO and GEO, and some tourism. The dominant value of space in these futures is in supporting global military information dominance and in disrupting or denying it to adversaries. These futures are polar cases where either the .. and its allies or the alternate leading space power and its allies maintain or achieve  significant lead in space information dominance and the ability to exercise space superiority. Space Today (Space as  Warfighting Domain): Positive The .. coalition is the leading military space power, though space is  highly contested warfighting domain and an essential element in integrated, cross-domain warfare. Commercial and civil space activities are limited to LEO to GEO systems with minor levels of tourism. Military space systems are highly resilient, maneuverable, robotically refuelable, self-healing to attack, highly integrated, artificial intelligence driven, highly autonomous, and reconstitution ability is enhanced. The . coalition holds the advantage in using civil and commercial capabilities to support military capabilities. Wild Frontier: Negative Same as above except an alternate nation and its allies are the dominant space power. 13 DISTRIBUTION . Approved for public release Key Resulting Military, Civil, and Commercial Characteristics Military   The importance of space as  warfighting domain has grown, including support to cross domain conflicts. Importance has grown driven by the increased capabilities for space systems to support global military information dominance and superiority in C4 capabilities both in and through space. The nation with  superior space military capability to obtain and maintain space superiority as required in time and space during conflict has  significant advantage in cross-domain warfare. Civil   The leader in civil space has significant advantages in:  Influence on or control over the civil space infrastructure to its own benefit, particularly during times of conflict. Establishing norms of behavior, rule and laws for space that advantage its military use of space. Forcing the non-dominant power to produce its own civil space structure. The distribution of the preponderance of civil power among space faring nations poses for the lead space power challenges to shape the civil structure to their benefit. The non-lead power pursues alliances to counter the lead power  civil advantages. Commercial   There is  significant commercial space economy primarily focused on communication, PNT, and Earth observing, with some level of tourism. The lead commercial space power has  significant advantage in the size and strength of the industrial base to support military space systems, providing the lead nation with advantages in the cost of production and number of its military assets. Commercial dominance provides greater ability to exploit the commercial sector capabilities to support military operations. . Conclusions Predicting the future with any fidelity is impossible. However, in this work, we have defined the broad characteristics of  range of futures and explored their critical elements in terms of .. national power. The eight scenarios that we developed based on the bounds of the human, economic, and leadership continua are  starting point for further analysis, thought, and strategy. Most importantly, through this first round of analysis, we have identified broad conditions that could have significant positive and negative outcomes for the .. in terms of overall national power. Subsequent workshops will identify possible inflection points that could lead us toward each of those future scenarios. Hopefully, this process will illuminate critical decision points and actions that will positively influence those futures. These additional workshops will also take  deeper look at other peer and near-peer space rivals besides China. This overall work will provide recommendations for the .. and allied space strategies and clarify near-term actions, policies, and investments relevant to achieving the desired end-states by the year 2060. significant benefit of these efforts will be an aid to determine  minimum set of essential capabilities in space required by the .. These minimum essential capabilities will in turn guide long-term science and technology roadmaps. 14 DISTRIBUTION . Approved for public release To summarize, one of the potential future scenarios explored here stems from positive answers to the three questions we posed about the future. In this scenario, space is  major contributor to the human economy, people live and work widely in space, and the .. coalition leads in civil, commercial, and military aspects of that future and have shaped the norms of behavior, rules, and laws that moderate space activities to reflect our concepts of  liberal international order (fairness, open commerce, freedom of movement, and international cooperation). This is the most positive future for the .. and it represents an aspirational goal for the nation. Our actions going forward should drive toward that future. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the space contribution to the overall human economy and human presence in space is small such that space  most important function is military. In this future space has grown as  contested environment and as  key element of cross-domain warfare and another nation has displaced the .. coalition as the leading space power. As  nation we must identify the inflection points that might lead us to such  future and act to avoid this outcome. From the SFW, six other potential futures were investigated between these two extremes in terms of their impact on .. interests and power. In order to move towards the positive space futures presented here, we draw preliminary conclusions from this exploration of these eight bounding scenarios. The .. should establish space settlement and human presence as  primary driver of the nation  civil space program to determine the path for large-scale human space settlement and ensure America is the foremost power in achieving that end. Accordingly, civil space programs must be assessed as to their utility to further space settlement goals. The Departments of Commerce, Energy, and Transportation, along with NASA, must execute  coordinated strategy to develop . space commerce and to incorporate space commodities and resources into the larger . and global economy. If entrepreneurs can achieve large returns from space commercial enterprises, the .. government must enact policies that ensure the .. captures the dominant position in that market. The .. must continue to lead in developing  rules-based, democratic international order for space. The .. must commit to having  military force structure that can defend this international space order and defend American space interests, to include American space settlements and commerce. The .. must establish  national approach to advance positive development along all three axes considered in this report. This strategy must emphasize unity-of-effort among the nation  civil and military space programs, as well as government departments such as Commerce, Energy, and Transportation, to deliver  space future that the American people desire and deserve. It must also maximize American and allied private sector involvement. The Department of Defense is  critical partner in such  whole-of-government approach to national space strategy and action. The DoD must embrace its role as an executing agent for this national strategy. It must commit to advancing American progress along all three space futures axes and its mission of defending . expanded military, civil, and commercial space interests. DoD programs must be assessed as to their military utility and strategic utility within the national space strategy. 15 DISTRIBUTION . Approved for public release   Examining long-term space futures along the axes of human presence, space economy, and space leadership is  powerful tool in developing  national strategy to achieve .. space interests. While the current work has defined reasonable upper and lower bounds for the state of space along these axes for 2060 and the futures they define, more work is needed to determine the key inflection and decision points that will determine the most probable end point along these axes for 2060 and the space futures they imply. The .. must recognize that in the world of 2060, space will be  significant engine of national political, economic, and military power for whichever nations or nation best recognize() the potential of space and organizes and operates to exploit and maximize that potential.

China is executing  long-term civil, commercial, and military strategy for exploration and economic development of the cislunar domain, to include the settlement of the Moon, with the explicit aim of displacing the .. as the leading space power. Other nations are developing similar national strategies. failure to remain the leading space power will place .. national power at risk. The .. and its allies must promote and optimize the combined civil, military, and commercial exploitation of space that best serves the nation  interests.

Recommendations This report documents the results of the first of  three-step process. It provides  longer-term perspective on possible space futures to inform current strategic space decision making.

Annex . Trends  Progress is not  straight line; the future is not  mere projection of trends in the present. Rather, it is revolutionary. It overturns the conventional wisdom of the present, which often conceals or ignores the clues to the future. (Dr. An Wang, Founder of Wang Laboratories) We identify three broad classes of trends driving the increased contributions of space to national power: Technology Advances in space science and technology enabling increased access and actions in space. Value Expansion in the range and value of commercial, civil, and military space capabilities. National Interest Increased understanding of the value of space capabilities to national defense and overall national power. Technology Trends Table    Technology Trends   Space launch innovation (.., driving down the cost of getting mass to space)   Foreign competitors increasingly seek cyber capabilities to target space systems and infrastructure. Decreasing satellite bus and subsystem costs   Increasing range of satellite bus sizes capable of complex functionality   Decreases in payload size, power, and weight while increasing payload capability   Distributed constellations of smaller satellites   Robotics and on-orbit maneuvering providing revolutionary capabilities to construct, move, maintain, and replace complex structures in space   Novel and deployable space power systems capable of supporting space infrastructure and potentially providing beamed power terrestrially   New space-based commercial capabilities, including manufacturing, taking advantage of low/zero gravity effects, and access to vacuum   National efforts (civil and commercial) creating technology to put humans into orbit and on the surface of the Moon and Mars as tourists, workers, and settlers   Advances in methods for resource extraction and use on the Moon and from asteroids\n\n18 DISTRIBUTION . Approved for public release Science and technology trends are transforming space as  domain for human endeavor. Broad advances in technology especially in the commercial realm are increasing access to space and opening up new applications and markets in space. This technology also has the potential to create new threats and will have unanticipated consequences in space. Any look at the future must include  careful examination of the benefits and potential hazards of new technology. Today, the field of space launch is experiencing the greatest burst of technological creativity driving change in more than 40 years. Innovations in reusability are dramatically driving down the cost of launch for moderate to heavy lift. Coupled with the proliferation of small launch capability, this provides unprecedented flexibility in tailored access for smaller satellite systems. Advances in this area are pushing the cost of space access towards the limit of fuel cost and launch system maintenance similar to today  commercial aircraft operations. On-orbit propulsion, refueling, and maintenance advances also promise to vastly increase space systems maneuverability and flexibility. Electronic and mechanical miniaturization is quickly driving platforms away from the large-satellite-fits- all model. Advances in sensors, communication systems, and computation are increasing the capabilities of satellite payloads while radically reducing their size, weight, and power. Advances in satellite subsystem technology is enabling more capable satellites from cubesats to 10,000-pound systems. Assembly line production of modular satellites and standardized subsystems is radically driving down the cost of satellites. Advances in autonomy and artificial intelligence allows for the distribution of capabilities across proliferated mega-constellations of small satellites. Advances in robotics are advancing capabilities for on-orbit assembly, repair, and repurposing. These current technology trends are driving potential new applications in space for the future, including in-space manufacturing of products for terrestrial use, biomedical advancements such as the growth of human tissue in space, large scale space power beamed to Earth, space habitats for workers and tourists and in situ resource extraction from the Moon and asteroids. These new activities will allow viable and growing commercial and industrial activity in space, and will advance civil and military space capabilities. Value Trends This trend is an expansion in the range and value of civil, military, and commercial space-based capabilities. In the short- and mid-term, space capabilities have growing value in an increasingly global and interconnected world   particularly in the areas of information gathering; position, navigation, and timing (PNT); and communication. Table    Value Trends   Information gathering   Precision pointing, navigation, and timing   Global communication   Emplacement and protection of critical space-based assets   Expanding human presence in space, on the Moon, Mars, and beyond   Creating markets for space tourism, manufacturing, biomedicine, space power, and resource extraction\n\n19 DISTRIBUTION . Approved for public release   Space-based capabilities to globally observe and gather information with ever-increasing cadence, resolution, and sensitivity have become critical to political, military, commercial, and civil information dominance. National and world infrastructure is increasingly reliant on PNT for military operations, travel, communications, banking, and point-of-sale transactions. An expanding list of nations are building national or regional PNT systems. Space-based communication systems provide truly global coverage and minimize ground infrastructure and interferences by rivals and adversaries. In addition, space communication systems could achieve lower latency than ground-based fiber systems, and equivalent bandwidth with laser cross-, up-, and down-links. In the mid- to long-term, the growth in value will derive from systems deployed widely in the cislunar space beyond GEO. Commercially, this value will derive from space manufacturing, resource extractions, human habitats, tourism, and power generation to provide products back to Earth and to further expand space infrastructure and capabilities. Militarily, the mid- to long-term value of space will derive from an expansion of the space operational regime. Expansion of the space operational regime increases the adversaries  difficulty in locating and negating key space elements required for information dominance during conflict in space and cross- domain. This expansion also provides increased flexibility in positioning and maneuvering assets to project power throughout cislunar space to achieve space superiority where and when required both for conflicts in space and as part of cross-domain conflicts. National Interest Trends The trend is for space to continue to grow in its contribution to national power across the civil, commercial, and military realms. New applications will unquestionably emerge, further elevating the importance of space to the nation and to humanity. The current civil space trend is increased use of space for exploration and scientific research, Earth and space monitoring, global PNT, and the development of the infrastructure needed to support the expanded use and importance of space, such as space traffic management, orbital debris mitigation, and deep space communications. Along with this development, the civil norms, rules, and laws to govern interactions between nations will evolve as space expands as  domain for human activity. Table    National Interest Trends   Development and control of civil space infrastructure and space norms, rules, and laws   Increased commercial space presence across  wide range of services and capabilities,  larger number of space entities, and an increasing number of space faring nations   Growth in importance of space in extending military reach and providing global information dominance to support ensuring national objectives in conflict, to include preserving friendly essential secrecy   Space as  key element of global infrastructure with DoD having an expanded role in protecting .. and ally civil and commercial space-based interests\n\n20 DISTRIBUTION . Approved for public release The commercial trend is for space to increase in size and importance as part of the global economy and, as such, as  greater contributor to national power. Commercial space will continue to increase across  wide range of services and capabilities,  larger number of commercial space entities, and an increasing number of space faring nations in Earth orbit and across the cislunar domain. The military trend is to extend the reach of military operations within the cislunar environment and to refine and expand space  role in ensuring global information dominance to support national objectives in conflict. The spatial domain of operation for space systems will expand beyond GEO to potentially encompass the entire cislunar domain with increased capability for and speed of maneuver across that domain. In addition, military actions will extend to the protection of military, civil, commercial, and human space assets. The trend is for space to become  more critical domain of potential conflict and an increasingly integral part of cross-domain conflict. Indications of Trends These trends directly shape the future of space as  domain of human activity. These must be considered in developing the .. national space strategy along with the nine key trends described in the .. Air Force Strategic Environment Assessment 2016-2046 (AFSEA). [] The AFSEA more broadly covers geopolitical, warfare, and human trends affecting all warfighting domains. This report and the AFSEA broadly set out the trends shaping the future. Recent events illustrating these space trends are:   China  space program is expanding, evidenced by the 2019 landing of the Chinese lunar rover Yutu- in the Von  rm  Crater to perform the first in-depth scientific investigation of the far side of the Moon from the lunar surface. The Chang   Mission is the latest step in China  long-term plan to put humans on the Moon by the year 2036. This goal is an element of China   grand strategy  to secure global technological dominance by 2040 and is integrated with the  Belt and Road Initiative  to secure world-wide economic dominance.

Vice President Pence and the National Space Council have set  goal for NASA to land American astronauts on the Moon by 2024. NASA is collaborating with commercial and international partners to achieve these goals. Commercial space investments are at an all-time high, led by inspired industrialists such as Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Richard Branson, the late Paul Allen, and an increasing number of venture capitalists looking to harvest new space revenue streams. At least one company, SpaceX, is developing  large lift and spacecraft system to explore and colonize Mars, with  goal of the first launch in the mid-2020s. Another company, Blue Origin, is focused on establishing space tourism, moving heavy industry off planet, and developing the Moon. President Trump published his National Space Strategy (March 2018) and has signed four Space Policy Directives providing direction in areas ranging from expanding the human sphere of influence across the solar system to recommending the standup of  Space Force within the DoD. 21 DISTRIBUTION . Approved for public release . Assumptions In addition to considering specific trends affecting space, defining space futures requires assumption as to the larger global state of the world in 2060. We make the following assumptions as to overall global economic, political, and national defense to the year 2060. Economic Assumptions    tripling to quadrupling of global gross domestic product (GDP) with an annual average growth rate of %-% over the period to 2060. .. economy doubling with an annual average growth rate of % over the period to 2060. .. portion of global GDP decreases from current 22% to between 10% and 15%.

Top economies are China, India, United States, Indonesia, Brazil, Russia, Mexico, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Global economy is more integrated and driven by automation, artificial intelligence, robotics, and additive manufacturing. The growing economy increases demand and competition for natural resources. Political Assumptions   Global political power is distributed across  wide range of nations driven by increases in overall global wealth and  more evenly distributed technical base and world economy. .. remains  first-tier power, but with its political power diminished relative to other first-tier nations. Tiering of nations by level of power continues with narrowed differences between and within tiers.

Wider distribution of power increases potential for competition and conflict. Premium on flexible partnerships and alliances to support shifting national needs and priorities and changing geopolitical balance. National Defense Assumptions   The continuation of great power competition. highly multi-polar world with  significant number of nations and alliances having equivalent economic power and technical infrastructure but diverse and divergent interests. Conflicts increasingly integrated across the air, land, sea, cyber, and space domains and extending globally and across cislunar space. The cyber domain is critical to space operations. Foreign competitors increasingly seek cyber capabilities to target space systems and infrastructure. Conflicts occur at greater speeds and range across an ever increasingly diverse set of integrated and flexible platforms and systems. Technical advantages between major powers has narrowed or disappeared. Success is driven more by resources, logistics, and successful alliances rather than by technological advantage. Wide range of conflicts involving  wider set of countries with significant military power. Increased global competition leads to an increased number of conflicts. 22 DISTRIBUTION . Approved for public release . Industry Perspective Members of the aerospace industry were invited to provide their perspectives during two workshops hosted by the Rocky Mountain National Defense Industry Association that preceded and followed the government based SFW. The first workshop solicited industry perspectives on the technical, economic, and political needs and gaps, investment opportunities (commercial and government), strategic importance, and the DoD and whole of government role for the following topics:   Exploitation of novel orbits and Lagrangian points   Domain sustainment   Lunar and asteroid resources and logistics   Space logistics and infrastructure   New and enhanced markets and services from space These perspectives were used as background information in the SFW workshop. The eight potential space futures developed during the SFW were discussed at the second workshop. Participants were then divided into three groups, each focusing on one set of possible futures: positive, negative, or military dominance. Three questions were posed to start the discussion: . What is industry' perspective on their role in each scenario? . What might be the inflection points that would drive us to each scenario? . What would be the industry approach to pushing us toward the positive scenarios and avoiding the negative ones? Results were compiled to identify both unique and shared perspectives between industry professionals. The outcome to the industry role revealed common points of emphasis:   The ultimate strategic objective of industry is to maximize profit. National pride and prestige are important, but the aerospace sector is becoming more international. In scenarios where the .. is not the dominant power in space, industry will turn to providing goods and services to alternate nations to continue maximizing profit. Industry  role always involves petitioning the government() for policy changes that make commerce more accessible. Governance changes are deemed to be required for markets expanding beyond GEO. Industry is interested in investing for and expanding to new viable markets.

Methodology The objective of the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC) Space Futures Workshop (SFW) was to scope the alternative space futures to the year 2060, and identify turning points, potential long-term drivers, and challenges impacting the role of space in the long-term. Specific focus was applied to .. and allied power and interests in the political, economic, and technological realms. China was the primary space rival considered during this first workshop. The SFW was conducted at the .. Air Force Academy over three days, with 52 senior scientists, decision makers, leaders, and professors participating.

On the final day of the workshop the facilitators organized the plausible futures along three axes in  three-dimensional alternative futures analysis. To do this, an alternative futures analysis technique developed by Shell Oil Company was used. This technique develops and explores  range of scenarios which, while not explicitly predictive, illuminates the spectrum of possible futures, and how they relate to national power. Such scenario-based thinking is  powerful means to consider and clarify multiple perspectives on the future and to identify potential inflection points and drivers for the future. [19] This analysis consists of three key steps, outlined below. Step : Determine the key trends, identifiable today, which will most influence space futures. From the workshop these were determined to be: Technology Advances in space science and technology enabling increased access and actions in space. Value Expansion in the range and value of commercial, civil, and military space capabilities. National Interest Increased understanding of the value of space capabilities to national defense and overall national power. These were examined in the context of the nine key trends described in the .. Air Force Strategic Environment Assessment 2016-2046. [] The AFSEA more broadly covers geopolitical, warfare, and human trends affecting all warfighting domains. The details of these trends are included in Annex . Step : Establish assumptions as to the general state of the world in 2060 that will affect space futures. These were determined to be: Economic The size of the global economy, the distribution of wealth, the degree of economic integration and the size and distribution of population. Political The distribution of power amongst nations, alliances and other entities. 26 DISTRIBUTION . Approved for public release National Defense The nature and extent of potential conflicts and the distribution of military power across domains and nations. The details of these assumptions are captured in Annex . Step : Define axes for space futures, define the maximum and minimum expected states along these axes in the context of the trends and assumptions, create  bounded set of space futures and scenarios, and determine the civil, commercial, and military characteristics of those futures. The three axes established for the future space scenarios were: Human How broadly and in what numbers do humans live and work in space? Commercial Potential What is the economic level of new wealth and persistent revenue streams from space activities? Leadership To what degree do the .. and allied nations lead in the creation of the civil, commercial and military space capabilities and in establishing the norms, standards, and international regulations in space? (.., based on free world concepts of  liberal international order?) The three axes defined by this three-dimensional alternative futures analysis are:   Human Presence. This axis defines the degree of human presence in space. End points extend from no significant human presence, to continuous human presence in large numbers and over  spatial domain from near Earth to the Moon, beyond to Mars, asteroids, and the other planets. Critical questions to address to define the scenarios along the human axis are:  For sustained human presence at large scale   is life possible in space for  broader audience, not just limited to professional astronauts and governmental entities? Is it possible for self-sustaining communities to exist? Is there an underlying economic rationale for continued human presence in space? Is it possible for large-scale, closed-cycle life support to enable human settlement (families and new births)? Is the technology possible, and have we achieved an ability to enable permanent settlement of meaningfully sized communities? Are we limited at the ability of the International Space Station to support very few government employees for short periods of time, at great expense, externally supplied, and unable to reproduce in space? Space Economy: This axis defines the degree of economic activity in space. End points extend from limited niche applications in communications; position, navigation, and timing (PNT); and information gathering to  complex economic ecosystem extending from Low Earth Orbit (LEO) to the Moon and beyond, with viable and growing capabilities extending to tourism, space-based power, resource extraction, space manufacturing, etc. Critical questions to address to define scenarios along this axis are:  In what economic areas is space activity profitable? What is the return on investment for these areas? Are there significant new industries that can be self-sustaining in space that generate significant revenue? Examples include: space-based internet, in-space transportation, in-\n\n27 DISTRIBUTION . Approved for public release space propellant manufacture, lunar and asteroid mining, space-based solar power- beaming, orbital and lunar tourism. Will space be  minor part of the global economy limited to current markets of satellite communication, PNT, and Earth observation? .. and Allied Leadership in Space. This axis defines the degree of economic, political, and military leadership in space that the .. and its allies retain. The end points extend from the .. and its allies ceding its present dominant position across any of these areas, to the .. and its allies retaining  dominant position in all three of these areas. Critical questions to define scenarios along this axis are:  How interdependent are economic, political, and military space leadership? Do economic and political leadership require military leadership? To what degree is leadership in all three areas required to establish standards and norms for space that are advantageous to the .. and its allies? In  flatter world economically, politically, and militarily, what is the degree of space dominance possible or required to secure national interests? As  starting point and to constrain the analysis, two limiting states were defined along each axis representing minimum and maximum realistic contractions and expansions. It was assumed that the states along each axis are independent of the states along the other axes. These three axes produced eight different named scenarios. 28 DISTRIBUTION .

The NASA GeneLab project has detailed information on radiation exposure using animal models with curated dosimetry information for space ight experiments. Methods: We analyzed multiple GeneLab omics datasets associated with both ground-based and space ight radiation studies that included in vivo and in vitro approaches. range of ions from protons to iron particles with doses from . to . Gy for ground studies, as well as samples  own in low Earth orbit (LEO) with total doses of . mGy to 30 mGy, were utilized. Results: From this analysis, we were able to identify distinct biological signatures associating speci  ions with speci  biological responses due to radiation exposure in space. For example, we discovered changes in mitochondrial function, ribosomal assembly, and immune pathways as  function of dose. Conclusions: We provided  summary of how the GeneLab  rich database of omics experiments with animal models can be used to generate novel hypotheses to better understand human health risks from GCR exposures.

Introduction Space is  hostile environment, and human space travel will entail  ects at many levels of biological organization leading to related physiological  ects. One of the major environmental factors Cancers 2020, 12, 381; doi:10.3390/cancers12020381 www.mdpi.com/journal/cancers\n\nCancers 2020, 12, 381  of 23 in space is radiation. Ionizing radiation in space is composed of  complex mixture of particles including protons from the sun and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) originating from outside the solar system. The GCR is composed of atomic nuclei, including  component of heavy charged and energetic (HZE) particles that are relatively few in number but highly ionizing. major risk-factor for human space ight is exposure GCR HZE that can cause DNA damage that is unrepaired or mis-repaired []. Current research has shown measurable impact on in several areas  ecting human health bone loss [], skeletal muscle atrophy [ ], reproductive hazards in women and men [], cognitive/behavioral changes [], central nervous system (CNS) decrements [,], and changes in cardiovascular physiology [10]. The possibility that space radiation exposure to increase cardiovascular disease risk requires additional validation similar to the ongoing observations of increased cardiac impairment observed in radiotherapy-treated cancer survivors [11,12]. Space ight has also been shown to have an impact on established cancer hallmarks [13], possibly increasing carcinogenic risk [14]. At the molecular level, space radiation from high energy photons and atomic nuclei can cause damage to cellular components, in particular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Damaged DNA, which is inadequately repaired, can led to mutations and chromosomal aberrations that have potential to propagate into RNA, potentially leading to cancer. Simulations using ground-based datasets representative of  combined space radiation and microgravity exposure have demonstrated that oxidative stress processes and mitochondrial dysfunctions are important contributors to biological  ects from space ight. Simulated microgravity studies have demonstrated an inhibitory  ect on cell cycle and cell proliferation [15]. These studies show the value of research centered on understanding the totality of space exposures [16]. multitude of other biological processes that are  ected include increased genomic instability and mutation rates [17], immune dysregulation [18], and deregulated cellular energetics [19]. Con icting results on cellular stemness [20] have been reported with  ects such as elongation of telomere and altered telomerase function that require clari cation [21,22]. substantial amount of work has also been generated in the area of omics. For several decades, omics animal-based studies have been performed to understand the human health risks due to space ight missions using the International Space Station, the space shuttle, biosatellites, and ground-based experiments. NASA  growing GeneLab omics database now hosts almost 250 experimental studies on space ight exposure and analogous ground-based experiments from microbes, plants, animal models, and human/animal-derived cell cultures [23]. These data are available as an open-access resource for single- and multi-omic analyses on microarray, RNA-sequencing, bisul te-sequencing, proteomic, metabolomic, and metagenomic datasets. Although these data are targeted to better understand the risks associated with human space ight, these experiments also demonstrate  unique stress that provides  better understanding of adverse human health  ects due to alterations in cellular behavior owing to factors such as microgravity, altered carbon dioxide levels, psychological stressors, and damaging ionizing radiation exposures from GCR and protons in the Earth  radiation belts. These datasets, and in particular the in vivo animal models used, present  unique experimental setting to study the cellular and host-level interactions that impact human health. In this study,  meta-analysis of these accumulated transcriptomic datasets in GeneLab relevant to space ight was undertaken to uncover potential dose-dependent biological responses that will help in understanding the human health risks experienced in the space ight environment. The studies identi ed were from human- and animal-derived tissues or cells exposed to protons and GCR HZEs at doses ranging from . to . Gy for ground studies and using samples  own to the International Space Station or shuttle missions with total doses between . and 30 mGy. Ground experiments are  well-established analog for space  ight, but are limited in that they are relatively high dose, high dose rate, and in most cases use single particle species, in contrast to the low dose, low dose rate mixed radiation in space. Further work is needed to elucidate platform-dependent di erences (mixed  elds now being  ered at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory [24] are  step in this direction). The datasets were pooled and subjected to gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify clusters of gene sets and associated biological processes. The results from this analysis highlight novel cellular\n\nCancers 2020, 12, 381  of 23 responses that may be relevant contributors to the combined  ects of microgravity and space radiation and therefore critical drivers of health risks from space radiation. . Results Using primarily in vivo animal models and their associated curated datasets available from the NASA GeneLab  omics database, an examination of biological responses as  function of radiation dose was made using transcriptional and sequencing data. total of 30 experimental conditions from 25 GeneLab Data System (GLDS) datasets were collected (Table ). Multiple datasets were included from human or murine cell cultures or animal tissues from several anatomical sites (adrenal gland, blood, bone marrow, brain, breast, heart, cartilage, skin, eye, hair follicle, kidney, liver, lung, muscle, spleen, or thymus). For the simulated space radiation ground studies (GLDS-73, -80, -109, and -117) information related to energy, linear energy transfer (LET,  measure of energy deposition at the cellular and molecular scale), dose rate, particle charge, and particle mass are available and can be viewed in Table S1. The dose data for all space ight experiments, with the exception of GLDS-111, were from instruments available on the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. Analysis was completed by subject matter experts from the Space Radiation Analysis Group (SRAG), Johnson Space Center, NASA. The provenance of data from GLDS-111 (Bion-M1) is detailed in the environmental data section of the GLDS for Bion-M1. The doses and dose rates for ground-based exposures are from the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory with uncertainties that are less than % [24]. Table .

Changes in RNA-Speci  Error Rates Comparing Space ight Versus Ground Control Samples DNA mutations caused by ionizing radiation have been shown to propagate onto RNA during translation, unless they are adequately removed by transcription-coupled repair. Higher doses of radiation exposure to  cell will result in greater accumulated damage, up to  point where the cellular repair mechanisms are overwhelmed. However, lower levels of damage may be replicated into RNA with aberrant  ects on translation and cellular function. Thus, RNA-sequencing data using mice liver samples from two experiments were analyzed to identify potential error rates due to space ight. Analysis of the GLDS-168 dataset showed no di erence in overall mapping error rates across the entire genome (approximately .%). Further investigation of the mismatches with respect to each chromosome identi ed error rates to be near .%; however, there was no di erence between the space ight and ground control groups (Figure 1A,). Interestingly, there were di erential error rates across some chromosomes, in particular the sex-associated chromosomes, and error rates for genes associated with mitochondrial DNA were lower than genomic DNA, supporting dynamic DNA damage repair in mitochondria (reviewed in [53]).",

Speci  base substitutions showed an increase in > and > substitutions in only GLDS-168 samples. We also observed  signi cant increase in CGT and GTA errors but  decrease in CAC and GTG errors in space ight animals versus ground controls (all corrected  < .05; Figure 1E). In contrast the GLDS-242 dataset showed an overall reduction, though non-signi cant, in speci  base errors with  signi cant change in substitutions ( < .05, corrected) in space ight animals compared to ground controls (Figure 1D,).

RNA-sequencing error rates in mouse livers from GLDS-168 (left column) and GLDS-242 (right column) experiments for space ight (black bars) compared to ground control samples (white bars). Error rates were examined as follows: (,) mismatch rates across chromosomes normalized by the number of bases sequenced; (,) single base substitution rates; (,) CAC, CGT, GTA, or GTG error rates. Signi cance indicated by * -value < .05 and ** -value < .01. .. Comparison of Multiple Genelab Datasets Using Principal Component Analysis Each individual transcriptome dataset was analyzed by comparing  ight/radiation exposure versus ground/control treatment. Utilizing standard bioinformatics pipelines for RNA-sequencing and microarray analyses, we obtained expression data for each dataset for use in gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) [54]. The results indicated  wide variance of signi cantly regulated gene sets per dataset (Figure ). When considering  false discovery rate (FDR) < .05, we observed some datasets with  low number of signi cantly regulated gene sets, whereas others had  high amount of signi cant results for the three GSEA molecular signature database collections (.., C5, C2, and C6). Thus, for further analysis, individual gene sets were considered for analysis if they had  FDR < .25 in 50% or more of the total datasets examined. Then, using Cytoscape  enrichment mapper, these gene sets were grouped into networks and further examined using the auto-annotate feature to cluster similar gene sets on the basis of biological similarity, referred to as  annotated gene sets . Figure .

The black bars represent the unaltered genes and the white bars represent the annotated gene sets. To observe if any trends or batch issues arise from this type of analysis, we compared the normalized enrichment scores (NES) for all the gene sets resulting from each molecular signature\n\nCancers 2020, 12, 381  of 23 database collection (Figure  and Figures S1 S3). Principal component analysis (PCA) plots indicated that there were no batch issues occurring globally for either the pre- or post-annotated gene sets as  function of dose (Figure ). In addition, we did not observe any tissue dependence or clustering for the pre- or post-annotated gene sets (Figure S1). Lastly, these samples were also clustered with -distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (-SNE) plots to observe whether di erent methods would produce con icting results (Figures S2 and S3). The -SNE plots also provided additional validation that no batch issues are observed with this type of analysis when considering dose or tissue dependence. Figure .

GSEA gene sets used were as follows: (,) C5 Gene Ontology (GO) terms, (,) C2 curated terms, and (,) C6 oncogenic signature terms. Each data point is represented by experimental radiation dose (color) or radiation type (shape). To compare the number of genes sets with the annotated gene sets, we provided heatmaps and clustering for all the datasets based on the NES for each molecular signature database collection for the analysis with the FDR < .25 (Figure ). As expected, the annotated gene sets provided fewer gene sets, enabling  more streamlined analysis downstream. The overall pattern of the datasets between the annotated gene sets and all the genes sets did not change. This indicates that any analysis on the annotated gene sets should provide similar results for all the gene sets. Cancers 2020, 12, 381  of 23 Figure . Heatmaps on all gene sets and also annotated gene sets for each molecular signature database collection. Euclidean clustering was used for clustering the rows and columns. .. Transcriptome Evaluation of Biological Functions Impacted by Space ight Exposure in Animal Models To observe the impact of radiation exposure, transcriptional data from experiments spanning  to 1000 mGy doses in animal models and cell cultures were examined for alteration in multiple biological pathways. This analysis combined statistically signi cant biological pathways that resulted from GSEA analysis for each individual dataset [54]. This included the following three major molecular signatures database collections: () the Gene Ontology (GO; C5) gene sets from biological processes, cellular components, and molecular functions; () the curated dataset (C2) gene sets from chemical and genetic perturbations and canonical pathways such as the BioCarta, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Pathway Interaction Database (PID), and Reactome pathway databases; and () the oncogenic signatures (C6) gene sets representing major pathways altered in cancer. ... GSEA C5: Gene Ontology Results Using Cytoscape  enrichment mapper, 63 statistically signi cant GSEA gene sets from the Gene Ontology (C5) database had  FDR < 25% in 50% or more of the GeneLab datasets analyzed. Using the auto-annotate clustering tool, these 63 gene sets represented  major biological pathways including: () ribosome assembly, () mitochondrial function, () interferon-gamma response, () chemotaxis, () cellular di erentiation, () extracellular organization, and () cytokine production (Figure 5A). Each of these clusters was driven by an overrepresented enrichment of genes related to these pathways. In addition to understanding common biological pathways disrupted by space ight and ground-based radiation exposure, these results were also used to examine possible dose-dependent trends. Using  -means clustering of the heatmaps representing each clustering nominal enrichment scores, six major annotated clusters were overwhelmingly represented this data, including () mitochondrial pathways, () leukocyte and adaptive immune response, () wound healing and VEGF pathways, () ribosome, () lipid pathways, and () mitotic nuclear division (Figure 5B). The nominal enrichment score (NES) for these annotated gene sets was plotted from 1mGy to 1000 mGy and  tted using  generalized additive model (GAM) smoothing plot [55,56] (Figure 5C). Indeed, there was an observed activation as  function of dose for the mitochondrial pathway, whereas the clusters for the ribosome, lipid pathways, and mitotic nuclear division were generally inactivated. more\n\nCancers 2020, 12, 381  of 23 uncertain trend was observed for the immune related clusters involving leukocyte and adaptive immune response as well as wound healing and VEGF pathways, demonstrating the complex nature of normal tissue responses to in ammation and immune responses.

Six speci  pathways were found to be clustered together through -means clustering.

Each panel represents one of the clusters and the color-coded lines represent GAM  ts performed on each GO-annotated term in the cluster. The circles in the plots represent the gene sets and the pink shade around the GAM  ts represent the standard error. We also performed an analysis with less stringent statistics, involving  larger set of gene sets, to observe whether other functions or pathways would appear. We performed the same analysis as above but included signi cant GSEA gene sets from the Gene Ontology (C5) database that had an FDR < .05 in only three of the GeneLab datasets analyzed. Although the FDR was set at  lower threshold, the lower number of required datasets with an FDR < .05 threshold (Figure ) would result in more gene sets for the downstream analysis. We saw this as true when observing the number of gene sets (Figure S4). Some -means clusters were too dense and were split into sub-clusters (Figures S5 and S6). The GAM  ts were provided for each cluster and sub-cluster (Figures S7 S9). As expected, this less stringent analysis approach produced less statistically signi cant  ts with more noise confounding the data. Interestingly, some new trends appeared that can be related to space radiation-induced health risks, including decreases in muscle-related pathways as  function of increasing dose (Figure S7) and decreases in chromosome pathways with increasing dose (Figure S8). This inclusive analysis strategy demonstrated that analyzing the data in many di erent ways can reveal relevant results when that can easily be missed with only one methodology and overly strict statistical cuto .

GSEA C2: Curated Dataset Results To expand these results, the canonical pathways (C2) molecular signatures database collection was examined in  similar manner to the gene ontology collection (C5) above. For this analysis, there were 30 total datasets as opposed to 28 for the C5 gene set analysis. We determined 411 signi cantly regulated C2 gene sets using Cytoscape  enrichment mapper with an FDR  25% in 50% of the GeneLab datasets analyzed. Due to the C2 GSEA database containing more gene sets,  larger number of gene sets and auto-annotated terms was expected. From these terms, we observed several key pathways, including mitotic and cell cycle pathways, cancer-related pathways, hypoxia-related pathways, interferon pathways, and pathways related to radiation impact on cells (Figure 6A). Cell cycle pathways [57], hypoxia [58], interferon dysregulation [59], and cancer [60 62] have all been observed in previous research studies as dysregulated due to space ight. We performed  similar analysis with C2 genes sets as we did with the C5 dose-dependent analysis (Figures  and ).",

Using -means clustering for heatmaps representing each clustering nominal enrichment scores, 15 major annotated clusters overwhelmingly represented these data, including () hypoxia, MYC, and phospholipid pathways; () EGF, TNF, and hematopoietic pathways; () E2F3, EGFR2, p53, and cell cycle pathways; () luminal, miR-21 targets, KRAS, and transformation pathways; () RB1, metastasis, mitotic division, and progenitor pathways; () hematopoiesis, interferons, and methylation pathways; () obesity-, oxidation-, and adipogenic-related pathways; () mitochondrial and adipogenesis pathways; () complex EIF binding; (10) progesterone; (11) apoptosis and phospholipid pathways; (12) in ammatory, invasion, NOTCH, and HNF1a pathways; (13) carcinoma, hypoxia, and IL1a pathways; (14) PKD1, ZMPSTE24, and cardiac dysfunctions; and (15) ICP with H3K27ME3 pathway (Figure 6B,). Similar to the C5 GO analysis, we observed an increase in mitochondrial pathways as  function of dose. Observing this trend with another pathway database provided additional con dence with these results. clear decrease with cardiac dysfunctions, PKD1, and ZMPSTE24 was revealed as  function of dose. Interestingly, de ciencies or decreases in both PKD1 [63] and ZMPSTE24 [64] expression have been previously shown to cause cardiac dysfunction. These observed biological functions seem to follow  trend that may have be missed by manual analysis. Lastly, less stringent statistics with an FDR < .05 in only three of the GeneLab Datasets was also analyzed for C2 gene sets (Figures S10 S17). Like the C5 analysis, more gene sets were clustered per group after -means clustering (Figure S10), leading to three clusters requiring additional -means sub-clustering analysis (Figures S11 S13). This less statistically stringent analysis on C2 produced additional trends through the GAM  ts that were not observed in the more conservative analysis (Figures S14 S17). clear decrease in TNF pathways was observed with increasing dose (Figure S16), and  novel pathway related to taste transduction was observed as increasing with dose (Figure S17). Interestingly, it has been reported that both olfactory pathways and taste are altered in astronauts, which was previously thought to be due to  uid shifts in the head caused by microgravity conditions [65 67]. These data also indicate that space radiation may have some impact on this interesting phenomenon. Cancers 2020, 12, 381 10 of 23 Figure .

GSEA C6: Oncogenic Signatures To observe speci  oncogenic pathways that may change as  function of space radiation exposure, we also included an analysis of the GSEA C6 oncology-speci  collection from the molecular signatures database (Figure ). From the annotation analysis, we discovered that the main oncogenic pathway\n\nCancers 2020, 12, 381 11 of 23 impacted by space radiation was KRAS (Figure 7A). KRAS is  known oncogene and has been heavily shown in the literature to be involved with lung cancer induced by space radiation [14]. The -means clustering on the annotated gene sets produced the following  ve clusters: () KRAS- and LEF1-related pathways; () p53-, mTOR-, KRAS-, and CRX-related pathways; () PDGF- and TGF -related pathways; () TBK1, VEGFA, and ERBB2 pathways; and () embryonic stem cells (ESC) pathway (Figure 7B). When observing each cluster as  function of dose, there were interesting trends that can shed light on predicting potential oncogenic risk for longer exposure to space radiation. Thus, the following known oncogenes as well as the most regulated C6 oncogenic signatures were speci cally analyzed as  function of dose for all datasets: () KRAS, () CSR, () p53, () ESC, () TGF , (), VEGFa, and () mTOR pathways (Figure ). These trends as  function of dose across multiple experimental datasets emphasized  need to functionally valid these observations. Figure .

Each panel represents one speci  oncogene and the color-coded lines represent GAM  ts performed on the multiple C6 pathways associated with that oncogene. The circles in the plots represent the gene sets and the pink shade around the GAM  ts represent the standard error. As in the previous sections, we also performed analysis with less stringent statistics with  FDR < .05 in only three of the GeneLab Datasets analyzed for C6 gene sets (Figures S18 S21). Because there are fewer gene sets in the C6 database, this analysis started to yield some of the same results as the analysis with the higher thresholds. The GAM  ts for each cluster and sub-cluster produced similar results, with one sub-cluster purely associated with TGF  demonstrating the same trend (Figure S21). Interestingly, one cluster associated with TBK1 did not appear in the higher threshold analysis and demonstrated  clear decrease in as  function of dose (Figure S20). Lastly,  major oncogene MYC [68,69] did not show up in the higher threshold analysis, whereas in this analysis MYC was clearly being activated with increasing dose (Figure S20), indicating that space radiation exposure would increase the potential for carcinogenesis. .. Common Genes as  Function of Dose and Association with Biological Pathways To look at speci  genes that might be common across all datasets, we performed analysis on the log2 fold-change values for all datasets. Nine genes (COPB2, UBE2D3, LYPLA2, ARF1, COPB1, CAPNS1, PHB2, DAD1, PRPF8) identi ed to be common across the space ight missions (. to 30 mGy) and ground studies (. to . Gy) were plotted as  function of dose and average log2 fold-change and   to  complex polynomial model. These genes, which were expressed across the various tissue types, displayed no signi cant expression  ects from space ight up to 100 mGy. At doses higher than 100 mGy,  slight deviation from baseline expression was observed (Figure 9A). The space ight studies alone showed slight  uctuations in expression across the identi ed gene sets (Figure 9B). focused analysis of only the muscle tissue datasets identi ed  subset of nine di erent genes that were di erentially expressed across the space ight studies from  to 30 mGy (Figure 9C). These genes displayed dose-response trends. The nine common genes associated with all tissue types were associated with pathways centered on Golgi to endoplasmic reticulum transport and post-translational protein modi cations (Figure 9D). In addition, these genes also were predicted to regulated phospholipid activity, immune dysregulation, and embryonic lethality. We observed these pathways to also be involved with our GSEA analysis as  function of dose. Cancers 2020, 12, 381 13 of 23 Figure . Common genes across all datasets.

Discussion Here, we presented  novel approach in using publicly available transcriptomic data to determine potential health risks and dysregulation of biological pathways as  function of space radiation exposure. The use of NASA  GeneLab platform [23] allowed us to mine data that might not have otherwise been possible to obtain from individual experimental datasets. The large number of radiation datasets available through this platform allowed the creative combination of di erent datasets from former experiments to generate new hypotheses [71]. Our hypothesis for this work suspected that there was  tissue independent dysregulation as  function of space radiation-absorbed dose that impacted key biological pathways associated with increased health risks such as induction of cancer. Because the GeneLab Data System contains space ight transcriptomic data from mice and tissues  own in low Earth orbit (LEO) for various time durations, we were able to obtain accumulated space radiation doses from  to 30 mGy. To obtain doses that will be more relevant to long-term deep space travel [,14], we combined our analysis with simulated space radiation ground experiments performed in the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory [24]. These experiments were performed on both mice and in vitro cell cultures with single ions (protons, 56Fe, and 26Si) at doses from 100 to 1000 mGy. Cancers 2020, 12, 381 14 of 23 By combining 25 GeneLab datasets over these doses, this work represents the  rst time  study has provided  comprehensive biological analysis and produced relevant and novel results indicating which relevant biological processes are being regulated as  function of space radiation exposure. These results may be further utilized to generate health risk assessment models and uncover potential targets for mitigation of space radiation  ects via novel therapeutics. We chose to  rst look at the distribution of mapping errors within the RNA-sequencing results from liver samples by examining whether mice exposure to space ight resulted in detectable changes compared to ground controls.",

We chose to  rst look at the distribution of mapping errors within the RNA-sequencing results from liver samples by examining whether mice exposure to space ight resulted in detectable changes compared to ground controls. We chose to focus on liver tissue datasets from GeneLab with mice exposed to space radiation because on in the GLDS liver is the organ with the largest number of sequenced tissue thus far from rodent research missions [71]. This extremely novel analysis demonstrates how RNA-sequence data can be used to generate useful data other than the standard techniques to generate counts. With  cumulative exposure of .20 mGy for GLDS-168 mice, signi cant increases in  >  and  >  base substitutions were detected, as well as changes in CAC, CGT, GTA, or GTG error rates (Figure ). However, there were no signi cant base-speci  substitutions detected, and CAC, CGT, GTA, or GTG error rates all decreased signi cantly in GLDS-242 where mice received  cumulative dose of .03 mGy; however, due to the uncertainty inherent in the  ight dosimetry, it was not possible to de nitively determine whether this was the case. major di erence potentially impacting the observed di erences between GLDS-168 and GLDS-242 was the animal sacri cing time at sample collection, which occurred during space ight for GLDS-168, but was  weeks after returning to Earth for GLDS-242. The recovery time for the mice after  weeks back on Earth might possibly allow recovery of the base substitutions and error rates observed during exposure to space radiation. The ability to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in RNA and DNA datasets has been performed previously on the basis of the assumption of  homogeneous genomic sample for example from  tumor [70], whereas the sporadic and stochastic nature of HZE exposure is expected to result in random damage throughout the genome [72]. Therefore, approaches to map SNVs on the basis of bulk tissue approaches may not be able to account for the stochastic nature of the SNV damage accumulated in  tissue. Our interpretation of these results was that the space ight animals may have experienced more DNA damage/mutation than ground controls, but in the animals that were returned to Earth, the recovery of the animals allowed for repair to take place. Next, purely on the basis of statistical analysis, we were able to determine key biological functions that were being dysregulated as  function of space radiation. For example, in the C5 Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Figure 5C), ribosomal pathways were observed as decreasing with dose. Ribosomal assembly consisted of  number of ribosomal protein large (rpl) genes that are necessary in the assembly of the eukaryotic ribosome 60S subunit, as well as the ribosomal protein small genes involved 40S and/or 60S subunit assembly. Indeed, ribosome-related genes have been previously reported to be disrupted following exposure to ionizing radiation [73 75]. We observed  clear trend of increased activation of mitochondrial-related pathways in multiple di erent pathway databases, which include both the C5 GO terms (Figure 5C) and C2 curated gene sets (Figure 6C). Mitochondrial gene expression is susceptible to radiation-sensitivity [76]. number of gene sets in these clusters showed dysregulation of the NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase (NDUF) gene family and mitochondria-related function, in agreement with  ects of ionizing radiation on the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes in previous studies [77 79]. This is especially relevant to human health, as the NASA Twins Study recently revealed mitochondrial stress and increased mitochondrial debris in the blood [21]. distinct elicitation of in ammatory and immune-related cellular functions was also observed in this analysis with alteration in chemokine, cytokine, and interferon expression (Figures 5C and 6C). Indeed, it has been very well appreciated that ionizing radiation exposure will cause both pro-in ammatory and anti-in ammatory expression as cellular signals attempt to resolve the unique normal tissue radiation injury that occurs both acutely and longer-term [80 82]. This immune signaling dysregulation has also been reported to occur when exposed to space radiation [83,84]. Cancers 2020, 12, 381 15 of 23 We also explored the potential cancer risk as  function of space radiation. The datasets we utilized for this study were from both in vitro and in vivo samples that did not have any cancer present and were not prone to induction of cancer. From our analysis, we observed several interesting results indicative of increased risk for the induction of cancer. In our analysis on the C6 Oncogenic Signature database, we observed that PDGF and TGF  were clustered together, purely on the basis of the statistics, and both were decreasing with increasing dose (cluster  in Figure 7C). This observation is closely tied to previously established  ndings. In the literature, PDGF and TGF  are closely related to cancer progression [85]. In addition, it has been shown in the clinic that decreases in PDGF and TGF  levels after radiotherapy for breast cancer can cause echocardiographic alterations  ecting cardiovascular morbidity [86]. We also observed the highest frequency of the KRAS pathway,  known oncogene [87], being impacted as  function dose (Figure 7A). It has been previously described in experiments with single ion species that KRAS can induce lung cancer due to HZE particles [14]. Our tissue-independent analysis did not demonstrate any signi cant induction of KRAS with increasing dose (cluster  in Figures 7C and ). This might indicate that either previous experiments done with single ions at higher HZE doses did not capture the dose-dependent trend in tissues, or when considering the full spectrum of ions at lower doses KRAS might not be the key driver in inducing tumor growth. Other oncogenic trends we observed were decreases in CSR, ESC, TGF , VEGFA, and mTOR C6 pathway levels as  function of increasing radiation dose (Figures  and ). TGF , VEGFa, and mTOR have all previously shown similar trends with increasing dose of simulated space radiation [32,88]. The ESC C6 term is refers to di erentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESC) [89]. This rather surprising result indicates that increasing dose of space radiation reduces the  ciency of stem cell di erentiation. It has been reported that after ionizing radiation exposure, mitochondria are heavily involved with stem cell development [90]. Exploiting these di erent pathway databases (.., GO, C2, and C6) provided key insights on how these di erent pathway trends are intertwined. The CSR C6 term refers to  common serum response  (CSR) speci cally related to  broblast serum [91]. Fibroblast serum response refers to factors released in the serum from  broblasts involved in assisting with wound healing during tumorigenesis [91]. We can relate the decrease to the CSR pathways to what we observed in the GO analysis (cluster  in Figure ) related to wound healing and VEGF pathways. We also observed with that wound healing should decrease with increasing doses of space radiation. This decrease can also reduce wound healing due to CSR and has shown that it can lead to tumorigenesis [91]. In addition, it has been reported that impairment occurs in space wound healing [92,93], and these data can potentially indicate an increased chance for tumor induction. These observed trends as  function of space radiation exposure revealed unique pathways that seem to be speci cally related to GCR, whereas some pathways from our analysis are known to be universal responses to radiation. The mechanisms of damage are common to highly ionizing radiation regardless of the source [94]; what is unique to chronic space radiation exposure is the combination of highly ionizing particles, low dose, and  low dose rate, which may have implications for DNA repair [17], mitochondrial pathways [16], and lipid pathways [42] as just  few examples of what emerged from our analysis. In addition, we found speci  cancer-related pathways that may be unique to space radiation. For example, decreases in TGF  [32], embryonic stem cells (ESC) [95], and VEGFa seem to be unique to space radiation. Space ight studies have previously revealed  plethora of  ects that radiation can have at individual doses or over  small range of discreet doses. However, the pooling and meta-analysis of these datasets in this study allowed for  unique visualization and comparison over  larger range of radiation doses. This in turn made it possible to identify trends in physiological response from low to high doses and provided insight into the response to accumulating doses that may occur in long duration space missions or over  few days during solar particle events. This technique may also be utilized to determine potential targets for therapeutic intervention. For example, because we report that mitochondrial pathways decrease as  function of space radiation, this argues for additional validation and research on speci  mitochondrial targets for countermeasure development. In addition, from this analysis we can extrapolate to speci  doses that may pose greater\n\nCancers 2020, 12, 381 16 of 23 health risks. This analysis can only be done by utilizing  large number of datasets that are available from platforms such as NASA  GeneLab. The resolution obtained from this analysis can easily be lost once we lower the number datasets that will be used. Our analysis has indicated several di erent health risks that may occur with increasing exposure to space radiation. Through an unbiased technique purely driven by statistics and utilizing  large amount of transcriptomic data from NASA  GeneLab platform, we were able to identify tissue-independent biological pathways that are dysregulated as  function of space radiation dose. We believe this technique can further be used with other datasets and databases to generate more hypotheses that will assist with determining optimal therapeutic countermeasures and targets that can mitigate space radiation response in humans. .

The raw data  les were normalized using the quantile method and then background subtraction was performed using  Package PIMENTo (v1.). Fold-change values between space ight/radiation exposure versus ground/control samples were calculated and used for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA,) with three molecular signature dataset collections (C2, C5, and C6 gene sets) [54]. These results were imported into Cytoscape (v3.) for further visualization and interpretation by the Enrichment Map tool [96]. Only gene set nodes with  false-detection rate (FDR) < .25 in at least 50% of the total datasets analyzed were considered for network evaluation.

Analysis on Common Individual Genes with Fold-Change Values and Fits as  Function of Dose  total of 19 space ight studies and  ground studies were selected from the GeneLab database. Table  summarizes the datasets including the tissue, species, the radiation type, and the measured dose. From each study, the fold-change value between irradiated and control for each gene was calculated. For space ight studies, the log2 fold-change was computed as the ratio of the space ight measurement to  ground control value. In studies where terrestrial measurements for ground control values were made in both an animal enclosure module (AEM, also referred to as the Rodent Habitat) and  vivarium, the AEM ground control value was used due to the similar module conditions experienced by tissue in the space ight AEMs. For the terrestrial studies that simulated space radiation, the experimental values were the samples that were irradiated with  speci  ion (.., 56Fe, 26Si, or proton) compared to the sham unirradiated samples closest to the time of irradiation. Across all of the studies, the most common genes probed were chosen, which produced nine genes present with all the GLDS sets used for this manuscript. polynomial of degree  was   to the data in the range  1000 mGy for all datasets. For  ts involving only space ight samples and only muscle tissues, due to the smaller range of doses up to 30 mGy, data were   using  polynomial of degree . All  ts were performed using  chi-square method via CERN  ROOT toolkit (..18/02,) [98]. The nine genes were entered in ToppCluster [99] to determine the predicted pathways and functions these genes will impact. The results from ToppCluster were imported into Cytoscape, where the predicted functions were displayed as  network. . Conclusions This work is an example of how GeneLab  rich database of omics experiments with animal models can be exploited to better understand the  ects of ionizing radiation and the resulting potential risks to humans. This large-scale analysis of multiple transcriptome datasets including RNA-sequencing and microarray datasets provides  valuable examination of dose-dependent perturbations of cellular function across multiple tissue types in animal models. Individually, these experiments were limited by  ight duration, resulting in  single accumulated dose from  micture of particles or, in ground-based studies, exposure to  single particle species. When analyzing multiple molecular databases using our approach to many omics datasets,  more comprehensive analysis of signi cantly impacted biological factors can be obtained than was previously possible.

Drosophila can be sent to space in large numbers to examine the effects of microgravity on heart structure and function, which is fundamentally conserved from flies to humans. Flies reared in microgravity exhibit cardiac constriction with myofibrillar remodeling and diminished output. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in isolated hearts revealed reduced expression of sarcomeric/extracellular matrix (ECM) genes and dramatically increased proteasomal gene expression, consistent with the observed compromised, smaller hearts and suggesting abnormal proteostasis. This was examined further on  second flight in which we found dramatically elevated proteasome aggregates co-localizing with increased amyloid and polyQ This is an open access article under the CC BY-NC-ND license ( *Correspondence:  (..),  (..).

Remarkably, in long-QT causing sei/hERG mutants, proteasomal gene expression at 1g, although less than the wild-type expression, was nevertheless increased in microgravity. Therefore, cardiac remodeling and proteostatic stress may be  fundamental response of heart muscle to microgravity. Graphical Abstract In Brief Walls et al. find that exposure to microgravity aboard the ISS causes heart dysfunction in  fly cardiac model. Hearts are less contractile and exhibit changes in genes and proteins that maintain heart structure and function. Effects are seen in several lines of flies, suggesting  common response to microgravity. INTRODUCTION Throughout history, humans have explored the earth, so much so, that few regions outside of the ocean depths still remain unexplored. This drive to go  where no man has gone before,  coupled with increasing pollution, climate change, and competition for scarcer resources, has brought humans to the point at which exploration and exploitation of other celestial bodies, such as the moon, asteroids, and other planets, is inevitable. However, our organ systems have evolved to work under 1g, and it is not clear what the effect of long-term exposure to lower gravity environments might be and how those effects are exerted at the cellular and molecular levels. Cardiac health has been  major concern of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) for many years, but the clinical evidence for decreased function and unmasking of asymptomatic cardiovascular disease is limited. Early studies performed on astronauts who had been in microgravity for only  few weeks to  few months failed to Walls et al. Page  Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 January 06.

However, the number of subjects examined in those studies was low, with sometimes conflicting results, and they were without discernable (cardiac) health risks, so it is difficult to draw conclusions. Experiments designed to mimic longer-term exposure to microgravity (bed rest in humans and hind limb unloading in mice) showed reductions in cardiac contractility (Platts et al., 2009) and increases in arrhythmia (Respress et al., 2014). Increases in ventricular contraction (QT) intervals have also been reported in astronauts after longer-duration flights ( Aunno et al., 2003), suggesting reductions in the cardiac repolarization reserve (Akoum et al., 2011), but those conclusions are again based on few subjects with differing genetic backgrounds. Dysfunction in several cardiac ion channels are known to cause long QT syndrome (LQTS) in humans, which can lead to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac arrest. The human ether--go-go-related gene, also known to code for the hERG channel, is one of the ion channels that contribute to LQTS. hERG channel dysfunction can be caused by alterations in the genes encoding this channel as well as by some commonly used medications (Sanguinetti and Tristani-Firouzi, 2006). To systematically explore the effects of spaceflight on the heart, we used the Drosophila cardiac model to examine how prolonged exposure to microgravity affects cardiac health. We report the effects of microgravity on heart function in wild-type (WT) fruit flies (Drosophila Canton- [CS]) that were born, developed, and spent   weeks as adults aboard the International Space Station (ISS) compared with their ground-based controls (Figure 1A). We also examined the effects of microgravity on flies with mutations in seizure (sei), the fly homolog of the human hERG gene. Our results show that structural and functional cardiac remodeling occurs in response to microgravity and that remodeling is more severe in the channel mutants. Cardiac RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) of WT and sei/ hERG mutant flies and follow-up immunohistochemistry studies suggest that alterations in proteostasis likely contribute to the observed changes in cardiac function in microgravity. RESULTS Lifelong Microgravity Exposure Caused Cardiac Dysfunction and Remodeling We used vented fly boxes (VFBs) to carry multiple vials of adult Drosophila, each with 10 females and  males, to the ISS (see protocol schematic; Figure 1A). Eggs laid on the food in the bottom of the vials hatched into larva that then metamorphosed into adults in about 10 12 days, all under microgravity. VFBs and vials containing live adult flies were returned to earth gravity, and flies were processed within ~ days of exposure to 1g (space-flown [SF] flies). We also collected flies that emerged from those same vials at 1g (days   after splash down) and aged them for  weeks at 1g before processing (space flight recovery [SFR]). For cardiac function assays, flies were dissected under artificial hemolymph and allowed to equilibrate for 15 30 min in fresh, aerated, artificial hemolymph. The contracting hearts were filmed with high-speed digital cameras (140 160 frames/ [fps]) for subsequent heart- function analysis (Fink et al., 2009; Ocorr et al., 2007).

Exposure to microgravity resulted in significant reductions in end-diastolic diameters (EDDs) of SF CS female fly hearts compared with hearts from ground controls (GCs) (Figure 1B, top left). This reduction was not the result of changes in the overall size of female flies because there was no significant difference in body length in response to microgravity (Figure S1A). There was  trend toward reduced diastolic diameters in male flies, which did not reach statistical significance, as well as  small reduction in the overall body length of SF CS males (Figures 1B, bottom left, and S1A). No significant effects of microgravity were observed on end-systolic diameters (ESDs) under microgravity in either sex (Figure 1C). Importantly, both sexes showed significant decreases in fractional shortening ([EDD   ESD]/[EDD]), which is an indirect measure of cardiac contractility (Figure 1D). The functional consequence of reduced diameters in females was  highly significant reduction in cardiac output (Figure 1E). As previously observed (Ocorr et al., 2017), cardiac size and output in sei/hERG mutant hearts were already significantly reduced at 1g compared with CS hearts (Figures 1B and 1C). Interestingly, there was  small but significant increase in diastolic diameters in response to microgravity in hearts from female sei/hERG mutants, which translated into  modest increase in the cardiac output (Figure 1C, top). The length of time the heart spent in diastole and systole was also quantified from high- speed movies. There were no significant differences between 1g- and microgravity-exposed flies (Figures S1B and S1C). However, hearts from female SFR flies did show  significant increase in the systolic intervals, perhaps  response to increased load when returned to 1g. Male CS hearts showed significantly increased cardiac arrhythmia (Figure S1D, bottom; arrhythmia index [AI],  measure of beat-to-beat variability) (Ocorr et al., 2007), which was not seen in SFR flies. The AI trended higher in females but did not reach the level of significance (Figure S1D, top). We observed the expected bradycardia and increased arrhythmia in sei/hERG mutant flies compared with CS controls at 1g, but it was not significantly worsened in microgravity (Figures S1B-S1D). Representative high-speed videos of hearts from both lines reared under 1g and microgravity are provided (Video S1). Transcriptome Analysis Reveals Differential Expression in Extracellular Matrix (ECM) and Proteasome Regulatory Genes under Microgravity After filming for cardiac functional analyses, hearts were removed and processed for transcriptomic analysis. Hierarchical-cluster analyses from triplicate samples from CS 1g (CS_G), CS microgravity-exposed (CS_S), sei/hERG 1g (sei_G), and sei/hERG- microgravity-exposed (sei_S) flies were performed. The results showed that triplicates from each genotype and condition clustered within their respective group. Genotypes clustered at shorter distances then those with microgravity exposure. Hearts from WT CS flies reared in microgravity compared with 1g GCs showed upregulation of 250 genes (.25-fold; adjusted [adj.]  value   .05); of which, 86 genes were increased  .-fold (adj. value   .01) (Figure 2B). Ontological analysis of the 250 upregulated genes using the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) functional annotation bioinformatics microarray analysis showed an Walls et al.

We identified 38 genes that were commonly upregulated and 189 genes that were commonly downregulated in both WT and mutant hearts under microgravity (Figure 2B). Within the 38 commonly upregulated genes, we identified multiple proteasomal/Ub-dependent protein catabolic genes, including ProsAlpha6, Rpn13, Npl4, and CG2046 (Table S1). Within the 189 downregulated genes, there was  .-fold enrichment in carbohydrate metabolic process genes (Table S2; Figure S2). Half of those genes mapped specifically to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) glycerophospholipid metabolic pathway and included key conserved enzymes, such as Agat4, Gpdh1, Gpd2, and Gapdh1 (Figure S2). Among downregulated genes, there was also  .-fold enrichment in genes encoding proteins found in the ECM. In addition, oxidation-reduction and proteolysis genes were enriched in commonly downregulated genes (Table S2; see also Figure S2). Nineteen genes were contra-regulated. Volcano plots (Figure 2C) show the relative distribution of differentially expressed genes in CS and sei/hERG, normalized to their respective GCs. In general, more genes were downregulated than were upregulated under microgravity, with more genes differentially expressed at  higher magnitude in sei compared with CS. Walls et al. Page  Cell Rep.

It should be noted that fruit fly hearts are very small, and the material isolated was insufficient to validate our RNA-seq analyses, which were run in triplicate, with qPCR. Microgravity Exposure Caused Myofibrillar and ECM Remodeling of the Heart We examined the cardiac morphology of GC and microgravity-reared flies in  subset of hearts used for the functional assays. Phalloidin staining of filamentous actin (-actin) revealed the myofibrillar structure within the myocardial cells that make up the heart tube (Figures 3A-3D). In CS GC hearts, the myofibrils are typically tightly packed and circumferentially arranged within those cells (Figure 3A), such that shortening of the sarcomeres results in  squeezing of the heart tube and ejection of the hemolymph present within the heart lumen (Video S1). Hearts from flies exposed to microgravity have myofibrils that are much more loosely arranged, with gaps, and were organized in  more- longitudinal orientation compared with 1g controls (Figures 3A and 3B). Myofibrillar reorganization or remodeling has previously been documented in hearts from sei/hERG mutants (Ocorr et al., 2017) and was again observed in hearts from 1g sei/hERG GCs (Figure 3C). However, hearts from sei/hERG mutants reared in microgravity showed even- more-extensive myofibrillar reorganization and disarray than GCs, and -actin staining was diminished compared with GCs (Figure 3D). To further quantify myofibrillar structure, we calculated relative sarcomere lengths from our -actin-stained  stack images (Figure S3) by quantifying the number of sarcomeres per 30-   myofilament length. Sarcomere number was significantly reduced under microgravity for both female and male Canton- flies (Figure S3), suggesting that hearts from SF flies were capable of generating less force than their GC siblings. Sarcomere counts in Canton- SFR hearts were not different from GC hearts and, for heart diameters, there were no significant differences among any of the hearts from sei/hERG mutants (Figure S3). In conjunction with the myofibrillar remodeling, we also observed  significant reorganization of the ECM surrounding the heart. In the Drosophila heart, this extracellular network consists primarily of the collagen IV homolog pericardin. Immunohistochemical staining revealed that network of collagen IV fibers surrounding the heart (Figure ), and we show that it partially co-localizes with the -band protein  -actinin (Figures S4A-S4H). In GC CS flies, those collagen fibers run orthogonally over the myofibrils of myocardial cells (Figures 3A and 3E) to form what appears to be  stabilizing network. Hearts from female CS flies reared in microgravity showed noticeable reductions in that myofiber-associated network (Figures 3B and 3F), consistent with the myofibrillar remodeling. Quantification of the cardiac muscle associated networks showed that this reduction was significant in SF female hearts (Figure 3G), although the decrease seen for CS male flies did not reach significance (Figure 3G). This result was unexpected because cardiomyopathy from compromised heart function is usually accompanied by increased collagen deposition, .., fibrosis. This myofibril-associated collagen network in sei/hERG mutant GCs (Figures 3C and 3G) was already significantly reduced compared with that of CS GCs (Figures 3B and 3G), also likely  reflection of the previously observed myofibrillar remodeling in these mutants at 1g Walls et al. Page  Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 January 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\n(Ocorr et al., 2017). Interestingly, we did observe intra-chamber fibrosis in  large percentage of hearts analyzed from sei mutants on the ground (arrows in Figures 2C ,3C, and 3C ), something we rarely observed in CS flies at 1g or microgravity. At 1g, 60% of sei/ hERG versus % of CS females and 65% of sei/hERG versus 16% CS males showed evidence of intra-chamber collagen IV localization ( < .005, Mann Whitney unpaired  test for both males and females). Unexpectedly, most hearts from SF sei/hERG females exhibited only faint collagen fibers, and there were large globular aggregates of collagen in the cardiac lumen as well as deposits that appeared to fill-in gaps between myofibrils (Figures 3D, 3D , and 3D ). Hearts from SF sei/hERG males exhibited more-extensive pericardin networks compared with SF sei/hERG females, but those networks were also reduced in microgravity compared with sei/hERG male GCs (Figure 3G). The observed structural and morphological changes (Figures 3A-3D and 3G) correlate with  complex misexpression of various cardiac sarcomeric genes, (Figure 3H, top). Control and mutant flies exposed to microgravity exhibit downregulation of human actin orthologs, including Actin88F (hACTB) and Actin79b (hACTA/). However, unique to CS, expression of the sarcomeric organizational gene basigin (hBSG), -band localized metabolic genes GAPDH1 and GPDH, and unconventional myosin jaguar (jar) (hMYO6) were reduced, whereas the later three were upregulated in sei/hERG flies under 1g. Conversely, sarcomeric organizational gene rolling pebbles (rols) (hTANC2) was upregulated in CS in microgravity. Interestingly, reduced expression of  variety of myosin-related genes was observed exclusively in sei/hERG mutants under microgravity, including myosin heavy chain (Mhc) (hMHC7), myosin light chain1 (Mlh1) (hMYL1), Myo10A (hMYO15A), and Tropomyosin  (Tm1) (hTPM1). Additionally, the observed changes in ECM content and morphology also correlated with misexpression of collagen/ECM regulatory genes (Figure 3H, bottom). Both control and mutant flies exposed to microgravity exhibit downregulation of procollagen lysyl hydroxylase (plod) (hPLOD1-) and lysyl oxidase- (lox) (hLOXL2). These collagen maturation genes promote collagen cross-linking and ECM formation. However, in SF CS flies, the collagen network degradative gene, matrix metalloproteinase  (MMP1) (hMMP14/24), was also downregulated. In sei/hERG mutants, cardiac MMP1 expression was elevated under both gravity conditions, relative to CS. However, for CS, MMP2 (hMMP15) expression was reduced in microgravity. CS flies exhibited  reduction in multiple collagen-type-IV-encoding genes, including Cg25C (hCOL4A1), viking (vkg) (hCOL4A1), Col4a1(hCOL4A1//), and pericardin (prc), as well as collagen and fibrinogen domain containing CG30280 (hFIBCD1) and CG31832 (hFCN1). Interestingly, most of these genes are upregulated in sei/hERG at 1g compared with CS, as would be expected under pathological cardiac remodeling conditions. Nevertheless, their expression shows  similar reduction under microgravity. The notable exceptions are the elevated CG30282 (see Figure 3H) expression in sei/hERG mutants, which remains high in space. Importantly, this misexpression of cell adhesion genes may underlie the observed misregulation of the pericardin network under microgravity (Figure S5). Walls et al. Page  Cell Rep.

Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nProteasome Numbers Are Significantly Increased in Hearts from SF Flies Remarkably, nearly all the genes encoding proteasome subunits were significantly upregulated under microgravity in hearts from CS WT flies (Figure 4A). In contrast, at 1g, proteasome gene expression was already reduced in the hearts from sei/hERG mutants relative to CS. Nevertheless, microgravity exposure also resulted in upregulation of cardiac proteasome genes in sei/hERG mutants relative to their sei/hERG GCs (Figure 4A), albeit to levels that were still reduced relative to CS GCs. Our observation that cardiac proteasome gene expression was significantly upregulated in response to microgravity suggested that protein folding had been compromised and/or degradation was elevated. We had  fortunate and unique opportunity to test that hypothesis on  subsequent mission launched to the ISS aboard SpaceX commercial resupply service (CRS)-11 using the same protocol as for CRS-03. For this study, we generated flies that expressed UAS-polyQ46 GFP only in the myocardial cells using  tinC -Gal4 driver. This GFP-tagged 46-glutamine repeat polypeptide (PolyQ46) is an intermediate length between disease-causing polyQ repeat lengths and the WT polyQ containing proteins (Melkani et al., 2013). Previous studies have shown that treatment with agents that increase reactive oxygen species in the heart increase the number and size of GFP-positive plaques (Melkani et al., 2013) in UAS-polyQ46 GFP- expressing hearts. In this respect, polyQ46 acts as  marker for protein misfolding and aggregation under cardiac proteostatic stress. Immunohistochemical analysis (Figure S6F) of hearts from GC flies exhibited GFP-positive plaques and anti-proteasome puncta (Figure 4C; GC), which were typically found near myocardial cell nuclei. Hearts from microgravity-reared flies had significantly more GFP- positive polyQ plaques (Figure 4D) covering  larger area of the heart (Figure 4E) compared with 1g controls. Proteasome puncta were also more abundant (Figure 4F), covering  larger total area (Figure 4G) of the heart. In addition, in myocardial cells,  significant amount of  -proteasome  haze  was observed, which could represent less-highly aggregated proteasomes (Figure 4C; SF). Taken together, these data suggest that, in the heart in space, proteasomal gene and protein expression is dramatically upregulated, although proteosomes are likely dysfunctional, as manifest by co-localized proteasomal and polyQ aggregates. DISCUSSION As humans increasingly venture into our interplanetary space, it will be important to understand the different ways in which prolonged exposure to altered  forces affect organ systems that have evolved under 1g. Muscle function is known to be affected by prolonged weightlessness, but most studies address the  bulk  properties of muscle fibers, leaving the cellular and mechanistic causes relatively unexplored. Knowledge of the biomechanical properties of filaments is important because those filaments reveal how molecular properties scale up and how bulk properties of muscle fibers are dictated by nanoscale phenomena. The current work, using the genetically tractable Drosophila model, provides new and unique insights into microgravity effects on muscle cells at the molecular level and also facilitates insightful structural and functional cardiac phenotyping at the organismal level.",

The current work, using the genetically tractable Drosophila model, provides new and unique insights into microgravity effects on muscle cells at the molecular level and also facilitates insightful structural and functional cardiac phenotyping at the organismal level. Similar to humans, exposure to microgravity has profound effects on fly muscle function, as has been Walls et al. Page  Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 January 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\npreviously reported for flies exposed to microgravity for short durations ( weeks) (Miller and Keller, 1999). Heart function analysis in our denervated, semi-intact preparations confirmed  cardiac- specific effect of space flight, with heart chamber size and cardiac contractility and output being significantly reduced under microgravity (Figures 1B, 1D, and 1E). These findings were consistent with observed myofibrillar remodeling (Figures 3A-3D), reduced sarcomere count (Figure S3), and misregulation of sarcomeric genes (Figure 3H), including actins, myosins and tropomyosin, and sarcomere organizational genes. Troponin mutations that interfere with tropomyosin binding have already been documented in the fly heart to cause cardiac dysfunction, cardiac restriction, and myofibrillar disarray (Madan et al., 2020; Viswanathan et al., 2014), similar to our observation in space flies. In addition, we previously observed that specific myosin-transducer mutations that affect rates of ATP hydrolysis have differential effects on myofibrillar structure, including restrictive (when rates are faster) and dilatory (when rates are slower) cardiomyopathies (Cammarato et al., 2008). We have also shown that mutations in unc-45,  chaperone involved in myosin protein folding, significantly alter myofibrillar structure in the fly heart (Melkani et al., 2011). Although  role for Myo10A (Sisyphus) has not yet been described in the heart, it has been shown to promote transport of cell-adhesion cargo and to bind integrins, which we have previously shown to be critical to cardiac structure and function (Nishimura et al., 2014), thus suggesting  possible role for this unconventional myosin in the heart. Sarcomeric contractile and structural proteins provide the fundamental molecular basis for cardiac function and have well-established roles in the etiology of  variety of cardiac diseases (Marston, 2018). Our studies show that prolonged exposure to microgravity is associated with transcriptional misexpression of sarcomeric genes, cardiomyocyte myofibrillar disorganization, and ultimately, cardiac contractile dysfunction. Lack of an effect on overall chronotropy, along with an increased incidence of arrhythmia in male flies is consistent with findings in human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (Wnorowski et al., 2019). Under pathological cardiomyopathy conditions, collagen deposition is usually increased leading to fibrosis, which contributes to impaired contractility. Surprisingly, the collagen IV network that normally surrounds and attaches to the cardiomyocytes was decreased under microgravity. Remodeling occurred in both CS and, to  greater extent, in sei/hERG mutant hearts, which also exhibited intra-lumen fibrosis and collagen aggregation. These observations were consistent with misexpression of collagen and ECM maturation and degradative genes, as well as collagen and cell-adhesion-encoding genes. Although fibrosis is generally associated with cardiac disease, ECM degradation is an observed feature in both the volume-overloaded heart and in end-stage diastolic remodeling from pressure overload (Frangogiannis, 2019). ECM degradation is associated with features of contractile dysfunction, inflammation, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, potentially due in part to loss of matrix-dependent signals that are required for preservation of function. Additionally, misregulation of ECM composition has also been implicated in cardiac disease. Taken together, ECM remodeling is  potential maladaptive effect of prolonged exposure to microgravity in our model and may be  contributing factor to the observed cardiac dysfunction. Walls et al. Page  Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 January 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nExpression of basigin,  transmembrane protein (Suzuki et al., 2016) involved in sarcomeric organization, was significantly downregulated in sei/hERG mutant hearts relative to WT at 1g, but exposure to microgravity resulted in an increased expression in sei/hERG mutants. Basigin has been shown to promote cardiac fibrosis in pressure overload models and to activate matrix metalloproteinases that degrade ECM components and thus promote ECM remodeling. This is consistent with the expression of MMP1 maintained in sei/hERG mutants compared with CS and may have  role in the dramatic collagen IV remodeling in SF sei/hERG mutant hearts. This sarcomeric modification may serve to stiffen the heart wall, allowing cardiac output to be maintained in mutants at microgravity, despite the myofibrillar remodeling and overall reduced expression of muscle structural proteins. Interestingly, basigin (CD147) has recently emerged as  potential receptor for SARS-CoV- (Zhou et al., 2020). Gap junctions are important intercellular connections among cardiomyocytes, allowing the organ to work as  syncytium. They are composed of connexins in vertebrates and innexins in flies. Innexin  and  have both been shown to be present in the fly heart (Cammarato et al., 2011). Under microgravity conditions innexin  is significantly downregulated in both CS ( .76-fold;  = .002) and in sei/hERG mutant hearts ( .59-fold;  = .045), whereas innexin  expression is altered only in sei/hERG mutants ( .-fold;  = .002). Together with the reduction in genes encoding cell-adhesion proteins, it is likely that electrotonic coupling of the myocardial cells was impaired. Another surprising finding was the significant upregulation of genes encoding nearly every subunit of the proteasome. We were able to confirm that microgravity exposure resulted in an increase in protein aggregates and associated proteasome particles on  subsequent flight. The increase in polyQ-GFP aggregates and proteasome puncta suggests that microgravity induces dramatic changes in protein turnover and/or protein misfolding. Recent evidence indicates that oligomers, such as huntingtin/PolyQ proteins, bind to and inhibit proteasomes by preventing injection of proteins into the degradation chamber (Thibaudeau et al., 2018). Additionally, proteasome dysfunction has been suggested as  causative factor and is observed in  variety of cardiomyopathies (Gilda and Gomes, 2017), heart failure, and cardiac amyloidosis (Pattison et al., 2008; Sanbe et al., 2005). We have also shown in flies that cardiac amyloidosis caused structural remodeling reminiscent of the remodeling observed in flies reared in microgravity (Melkani et al., 2013). The increase in proteosome gene and protein expression in space may reflect increased turnover of sarcomeric proteins or may be  compensatory response to the likely muted proteosome function by misfolded and aggregated proteins. This interpretation is consistent with smaller hearts and less muscle mass, as in astronauts, and could be contributing to the observed cardiac remodeling and functional defects. Interestingly, in hearts from + channel mutants, expression of nearly all proteasome genes was already downregulated at 1g compared with WT controls. Nevertheless, proteasome gene expression was modestly upregulated in hearts from space- reared mutants suggesting that this may be  fundamental response of cardiac muscle to lowered gravity. It is likely that this generalized increase in proteasome content underlies cardiac muscle atrophy. Walls et al. Page 10 Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 January 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nIn contrast to the increase in proteasomes, expression of proteolytic genes was generally downregulated in microgravity. Recent quantitative analyses of human cardiac fuel usage showed that non-failing hearts undergo proteolysis and actively secrete amino acids. This process was nearly doubled in failing versus non-failing hearts (Murashige et al., 2020). It was unclear whether upregulation of proteolysis was adaptive or maladaptive. In this context, it is interesting that SF fly hearts showed decreased expression, perhaps as  reflection of an overall reduction or shift in fuel usage by the heart under microgravity. The current studies examined the effects of prolonged exposure to microgravity, whereas the exposure of astronauts is more temporally limited. However, future space exploration efforts by government and commercial ventures are focused on missions to the moon, asteroids, and Mars, and those explorations will require astronauts to spend many months and perhaps years in altered gravity. Thus, information on how prolonged microgravity exposure affects different organ systems will be critical to the success of those efforts (Criscuolo et al., 2020; Prasad et al., 2020). It is likely that, at the cellular level, there are underlying and conserved responses to altered gravity that are shared between organisms. Approximately 75% of disease-causing genes are conserved between flies and humans. Thus, the fly model can have  key role in elucidating the effects of microgravity during prolonged space flight, with significant advantages over other model systems because of its small size, its well defined and conserved genetics, and its relatively short lifespan.

EXPERIMENTAL MODEL AND SUBJECT DETAILS Fly rearing and   exposure  Fly lines used in this study were Canton  laboratory WT lines (Bloomington Stock Center) and  + channel mutant seizure (seizurets1,  gift from Dr. Barry Ganetsky). The sei/hERG mutants were previously isolated in  screen for ethylmethane sulfonate (EMS)-induced paralytic mutations on the second chromosome (Titus et al., 1997). Flies launched to the International Space Station (space flown, SF) and the corresponding ground controls (GC) were housed in polystyrene vials (75 x24 mm) with 10 mL of standard cornmeal-based fly food containing double the usual amount of 10% Walls et al.

Approximately 24 hours prior to launch, 15 vials were each loaded with 10 virgin females and  male adult flies. Loaded vials were placed in  Plexiglas tray and inserted into  vented fly box (VFB; Figure 1A),  modified version of  Nanoracks box. The VFB was placed into  canvas case for loading into the Dragon capsule. Launch of SpaceX CRS- occurred at 19:25 UTC on April 18, 2014. Flies were kept in the VFB throughout the 30-day mission and were stored aboard the docked Dragon capsule that shared atmosphere with the ISS. The Dragon capsule unberthed at 13:26 UTC (Co-ordinated Universal Time) on May 18, 2014 and re-entry into the Earth  atmosphere occurred the same day at 19:05 UTC. Following retrieval of the Dragon capsule off the coast of Mexico, the VFB was offloaded at Long Beach Port, California and transported by car to La Jolla, California in  climate-controlled vehicle. Surviving adult flies were collected from the vials at 23:30 UTC on May 20, 2014. Data collection, which included heart function studies, tissue collection for RNaseq, and tissue preservation for immunohistochemistry, was completed by 07:30 UTC on May 21, 2014 on all   space flown and corresponding ground control flies (specific methods described below). The protocol and associated timeline are outlined schematically in Figure . The VFB was oriented such that the -load was directed down into the food supply located at the bottom of the vials.",

The protocol and associated timeline are outlined schematically in Figure . The VFB was oriented such that the -load was directed down into the food supply located at the bottom of the vials. This orientation was maintained throughout the entirety of the mission, from point of transfer at the lab at NASA Kennedy Space Center through stowage on the Dragon capsule, and again from Dragon un-berthing to opening of the VFB in the lab at SBP Medical Discovery Institute in La Jolla, California. Ground control flies were prepared and reared under identical conditions in ground-based incubators with temperature and humidity controlled to levels recorded on the ISS. Following initial adult fly collections, vials were maintained for three days at 25  and adults that emerged were collected and aged as  mixed sex cohort for two weeks at 1g (Space Flight Recovery, SFR). These flies were then analyzed as for SF and GC flies. Identical protocols were followed for the launch of the PolyQ46 flies aboard SpaceX CRS-11 on June 03, 2017 at 21:07 UTC until splashdown which occurred at 12:12 UTC on July 03, 2017. VFBs were again returned to Long Beach Port, California and transported via  climate-controlled vehicle to La Jolla, California on the same day, arriving at approximately 03:00 UTC on July , 2017. All dissections and fixation of heart tissue (described below) were performed within 48 hours of arrival in La Jolla. METHOD DETAILS Heart Function Assays  Flies were anaesthetized with FlyNap  (Carolina Biological Supply Co, Burlington, NC) and dissected in artificial hemolymph as previously described (Vogler and Ocorr, 2009). Cardiac function was assayed using high speed digital imaging (100-150fps, 9300 EM-CCD cameras, Hamamatsu Corp.). Heart function was quantified from movies using the Semi-automatic Optical Heartbeat Analysis software (SOHA; sohasoftware.com; Ocorr, 2009). Contractility was estimated based on end diastolic (EDD) and end systolic (ESD) diameters, measured from moves using SOHA. (.., fractional shortening = (EDD-ESD)/EDD). Cardiac output (CO) was calculated assuming the heart is  cylindrical tube, where volume was estimated using  =  (r2) , for   micron portion of Walls et al. Page 12 Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 January 06. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript\n\nthe tube ( = ). Thus, Stroke Volume (SV) = ( (/(EDD2) ( (/(ESD2) and cardiac output  ) = mean heart rate  SV. Immunohistochemistry  Dissected hearts previously used for the heart function assays were subsequently relaxed with EGTA (10mM in artificial hemolymph) and then immediately fixed for 20 minutes in  solution of hemolymph containing % paraformaldehyde. All hearts were stained as described in Alayari et al. (2009). Collagen IV was visualized using  monoclonal antibody against Pericardin, obtained from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank and developed under the auspices of the NICHD and maintained by The University of Iowa, Department of Biology, Iowa City, IA 52242. Proteasomes were visualized using an antibody against 20S proteasome subunits a1,,,, &  (BML-PW8195, Enzo Life Sciences, Farmingdale, NY). PolyQ-GFP plaques were identified using Mouse anti-GFP (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) The following secondary antibodies were used: anti-rabbit IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 and anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) -actin was detected using Phalloidin-Alexa Fluor 594 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Stained hearts were visualized with  Zeiss Apotome microscope;  stack images were captured and processed with Axiovision software (Zeiss). Pericardin, proteosome and polyQ46-GFP staining was quantified using the Weka Trainable Segmentation plugin in ImageJ (Schneider et al., 2012). Individual slices from  stack images of heart chambers were constructed by optical sectioning of the heart tube starting at  point below the non-cardiac longitudinal fibers. This optical sectioning revealed the pericardin fibers that interacted with the myofibrils in the dorsal myocardial cells. We selected  350   150-pixel (90x 30 um) region of interest (ROI) centered over  heart chamber (Figures 3E and 3F) and  representative image (.., Figure S6, left panel) was used for training; the model generated by the training was then applied to all images. Particle counts and area measurements were performed on the segmentation output images (Figure S6, middle panel) using ImageJ analysis tools (Figure S6, right panel). Sarcomere numbers were quantified from  stacks of hearts stained for -actin(with phalloidin). Two to three 30um segments of single myofilaments were identified in myocardial cells from each heart (Figure S3) and the number of sarcomeres were counted and averaged for each heart. Cardiac RNaseq Analysis Gene expression analysis was performed on  subset of adult fly hearts from both 1g ground control flies and flies that spent their entire existence in  . For each genotype, adult Drosophila were dissected under artificial hemolymph as described in Vogler and Ocorr (2009), on ice to expose the heart. These hearts were then carefully cleaned of surrounding fat cells, extracted, and pooled in groups of -15 hearts. Hearts were placed into tubes containing 300   of Qiazol lysis reagent, homogenized per the QIAGEN protocol, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and transferred to  80  for storage. Total RNA from each sample was extracted and purified using the miRNeasy Mini kit from QIAGEN (Cat. No. 217004), yielding 173~551 ng of RNA eluted in 30   of RNase free water. The integrity of the extracted RNA was assessed by Agilent 2200 Tapestation system Walls et al. Page 13 Cell Rep. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2021 January 06.

RNA samples of high quality and sufficient RNA quantities were selected for further processing. Libraries and sequencing Libraries of extracted RNA samples were built using the Illumina TruSeq  RNA sample preparation kit and yielded fragments with 200~500 base pairs. The qualified fragments were ligated with indexed adapters, amplified and subjected for sequencing by Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA) to generate paired end reads with  length of 100 bases. Pre-processing of heart RNA-seq Data  total of .02 billion reads were generated in FASTQ format for 24 samples, yielding coverage in the range of 35-152 bases for each sample. The quality of reads was evaluated by FASTX-Toolkit (Hannon Lab, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA), where all reads indicated excellent quality with an average quality score of 37. The reads were then aligned to the Drosophila melanogaster genome Ensembl.BDGP5 using TopHat2 and Bowtie2 .The aligned reads were then assembled using BEDTools (Quinlan and Hall, 2010). The samples with low alignment rate and biased expression patterns were excluded from further analyses. Expression of mRNAsin qualified samples were then normalized as Reads Per Kilobase per Million reads (RPKM) by AltAnalyze (Salomonis et al., 2009). Genes with insufficient copy numbers were filtered out before conducting further statistical analyses. Differential expression and functional annotation clustering analysis of RNA- seq data Differentially expressed genes were determined using  one-way ANOVA analysis considering   value of .05. Pathway enrichment analysis was performed by comparing differentially expressed genes with Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases using  Fisher  exact test-based method (Evangelou et al., 2012) where  < .05 was considered to be statistically significant. QUANTIFICATION AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Quantification methods for the various parameters are described in the relevant Methods Section. Statistical analyses were performed using Prism (Graph Pad, .). The specific tests used are indicated in the Figure legends. values for significant differences are indicated in the graphs. All graphs show the individual data points used in the analysis. Supplementary Material Refer to Web version on PubMed Central for supplementary material.

Efficient root elongation and bending depends upon the coordinated action of environmental sensing, signal transduction, and growth responses. The actin cytoskeleton is  highly plastic network that constitutes  point of integration for environmental stimuli and hormonal pathways. In this review, we present  detailed compilation highlighting the importance of the actin cytoskeleton during primary root growth and we describe how actin-binding proteins, plant hormones, and actin- disrupting drugs affect root growth and root actin. We also discuss the feedback loop between actin and root responses to light and gravity. Actin affects cell division and elongation through the control of its own organization. We remark upon the importance of longitudinally oriented actin bundles as  hallmark of cell elongation as well as the role of the actin cytoskeleton in protein trafficking and vacuolar reshaping during this process. The actin network is shaped by  plethora of actin-binding proteins; however, there is still  large gap in connecting the molecular function of these proteins with their developmental effects. Here, we summarize their function and known effects on primary root growth with  focus on their high level of specialization. Light and gravity are key factors that help us understand root growth directionality. The response of the root to gravity relies on hormonal, particularly auxin, homeostasis, and the actin cytoskeleton. Actin is necessary for the perception of the gravity stimulus via the repositioning of sedimenting statoliths, but it is also involved in mediating the growth response via the trafficking of auxin transporters and cell elongation. Furthermore, auxin and auxin analogs can affect the composition of the actin network, indicating  potential feedback loop. Light, in its turn, affects actin organization and hence, root growth, although its precise role remains largely unknown. Recently, fundamental studies with the latest techniques have given us more in-depth knowledge of the role and organization of actin in the coordination of root growth; however, there remains  lot to discover, especially in how actin organization helps cell shaping, and therefore root growth.

The primary root is the first organ to emerge from the seed, and therefore, its developmental plasticity is of utmost importance. The cytoskeleton is an interconnected filamentous network that is the key in controlling cell shape, rigidity, supports intracellular processes, and consists of microtubules and actin filaments (AF). AF consist of two helical strands of actin monomers that grow from the barbed plus end (compared to the pointed minus end) and rely on  plethora of actin-binding proteins to modify their organization and dynamics. Actin filaments are crucial for cell and tissue growth and participate in  large variety of processes including cell architecture and polarity establishment, signal transduction, cell-cell communication, cell division, and response to pathogens. Furthermore, the actin cytoskeleton is known to be an important player in vesicle trafficking, secretion, and endocytosis as well as endomembrane remodeling. By controlling the growth and division of cell, the actin cytoskeleton provides the means to dynamically respond to intracellular and extracellular stimuli (Mao et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2016; Maeda et al., 2020) (Reviewed in Paez-Garcia et al., 2018; Li and Day, 2019; Takatsuka and Ito, 2020; Yang et al., 2020). The actin cytoskeleton responds to an extensive amount of stimuli, such as gravity, osmotic stress, pathogens, nutrients, and light (Henty-Ridilla et al., 2013; Leontovy ov  et al., 2019) (Reviewed in Li and Day, 2019; Nakamura et al., 2019; Wang and Mao, 2019; Leontovy ov  et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021). Plant hormones, and especially auxin, have strong effects on the composition of actin filaments (Arieti and Staiger, 2020; Reviewed in Zhu and Geisler, 2015). The actin cytoskeleton has been studied extensively; however, the role that it plays in regulating the growth of the primary root is complex and often yields conflicting data. We hereby review how actin helps root growth. We first discuss how actin filaments organize during root growth. Then, we dissect how individual components of the actin filaments and the actin-binding proteins affect root growth. Next, we describe the evidence on how the hormones controlling growth affect the actin cytoskeleton and finally we discuss how actin affects the root tropisms to gravity and light. ACTIN ORGANIZATION AND DYNAMICS CORRELATE WITH ROOT CELL ELONGATION The main region that sustains primary root growth is the root apical meristem (RAM) through  tight balance between cell division and elongation (Ioio et al., 2008; Reviewed in Takatsuka and Umeda, 2014;  tv  et al., 2021). The actin cytoskeleton has been connected to root growth through its participation mainly in cell expansion and, secondarily, cell division (Ingouff et al., 2005; Kandasamy et al., 2009; Takatsuka et al., 2018; Arieti and Staiger, 2020). Root meristem cells undergo two steps of rapid cell elongation. The first one occurs in the progression between the apical meristem and the transition zone (TZ), which is triggered by an endoreduplication event. second fast elongation takes place in the boundary of the transition and elongation zones (EZ), characterized by an increase in vacuolar enlargement accompanied by cell wall loosening and new material deposition (Reviewed in Verbelen et al., 2006; Takatsuka and Umeda, 2014; Barrada et al., 2015). Actin cytoskeleton dynamics have often been connected to root cell elongation. Initial studies in the monocot Zea mays pointed out specific actin arrangements depending on the cellular developmental stage in the longitudinal axis of the RAM. Immunolocalization revealed longitudinally oriented, often bundled, Filamentous actin (-actin) in elongating cells while this disposition was lost during maturation (Balu ka et al., 1997; Blancaflor and Hasenstein, 1997). Later, more detailed work has been done describing actin cytoskeleton organization and dynamics in epidermal root cells of the model dicot Arabidopsis thaliana. There are clear differences between RAM zones (Figure ); to start with, meristematic cells show  pattern of dense, highly disorganized actin, characterized by relatively low levels of bundling and reduced longitudinal orientation and parallel arrangement of microfilaments (Wang et al., 2004; Arieti and Staiger, 2020). The TZ shows comparable actin filament density to that of the meristem; microfilament orientation remains random but an increase in parallel organization is observed. Actin dynamics in this developmental stage are reduced, although there is an increase in annealing events (Takatsuka et al., 2018; Zou et al., 2019; Arieti and Staiger, 2020). An increase in longitudinal actin filament bundling occurs preceding the second fast growth event during the transition to the EZ (Takatsuka et al., 2018). Cells in the elongation zone show  pattern of  diffuse and less dense actin network with longitudinal bundled arrays that display higher dynamics and longer, faster growing actin filaments (Wang et al., 2004; Dyachok et al., 2011; Jacques et al., 2013; Va kebov  et al., 2018; Zou et al., 2019; Arieti and Staiger, 2020). As  generalization, there is  correlation between root cell length and the presence of less dense, more bundled and longitudinally oriented actin filaments (see overview in Figure ). We do not know whether these differences in actin organization are coupled to different roles of actin, or that it simply reflects the differences in cell morphology at different developmental stages. useful way of correlating changes in actin with the effects on root growth is the analysis of the effects of actin-disrupting drugs on root growth (for  summary of drugs, see Table ). Actin-stabilizing compounds such as phalloidin and Jasplakinolide, which interfere with the correct maturing of -actin and prevent its turnover (Pospich et al., 2020), do not inhibit root growth. Actin- depolymerizing drugs Latrunculin  and Cytochalasin, which sequester actin monomers or bind to the ends of -actin, respectively, were shown to inhibit root growth (Balu ka et al., 2001; Mancuso et al., 2006). Latrunculin  induces  reduction in -actin density and an increase in bundling accompanied\n\nGarc -Gonz lez and van Gelderen Actin and Primary Root Growth Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org  December 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 777119 by  reduction in filament elongation rate and dynamics (Staiger et al., 2009; Rosero et al., 2013). Actin disruption by Latrunculin  treatment seems to influence cell elongation rather than cell division in roots of both . thaliana and . mays (Balu ka et al., 2001). Thus, in this case it is clear that the increase in bundling of actin is not directly related to promoting root growth, but that other mechanisms are also important. The myosin ATPase inhibitor ,-Butanedione -Monoxime (BDM) impacts the myosin-based actin cytoskeleton movement and also disrupted root growth in both . thaliana and . mays ( amaj et al., 2000; Mancuso et al., 2006). Interestingly, BDM impacted myosin-based actin movement mainly in the transition zone and beginning of the elongation zone, thus affecting the progression to cell elongation (see overview in Figure ;  amaj et al., 2000). Cell growth has been proposed to be driven by  sequential coordination between cell wall modification and turgor pressure changes (Zimmermann et al., 1980). In this context,  turgor pressure increase is expected to raise the mechanical pressure on the cell wall, aiding cell elongation (Reviewed in Kaiser and Scheuring, 2020). The actin cytoskeleton has been demonstrated to be key component of cell wall remodeling, mediating vesicle transport of cellulose synthase (CESA) complexes, cell wall modifying enzymes (.., expansins) or non-cellulosic cell wall components (Balu ka et al., 2002; Leucci et al., 2006; Crowell et al., 2009; Sampathkumar et al., 2013). It is thought that the actin cytoskeleton transports vesicles containing cell wall modifying components that promote cell elongation. This hypothesis is supported by the negative effect of Latrunculin -mediated actin depolymerization on the dynamics of CESA-containing Golgi bodies in roots or the decreased delivery and uptake of pectins and other polysaccharide components of the cell wall observed in other plant tissues (Balu ka et al., 2002; Leucci et al., 2006; Sampathkumar et al., 2013). Conversely, plant cells treated with the cell wall inhibitor isoxaben or mutants with decreased cellulose content show altered -actin distribution (Tolmie et al., 2017; Huang et al., 2020).

Garc -Gonz lez and van Gelderen Actin and Primary Root Growth Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org  December 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 777119 Another important player in maintaining turgor pressure in plant cells is vacuoles. Vacuolar occupancy of the cell increases with and correlates with cell elongation ( nser et al., 2019). In other plant cell models such as BY- cells or stomata guard cells, actin has been shown to play an important role in vacuolar remodeling (Higaki et al., 2006; Li et al., 2013). Actin inhibitor studies have demonstrated the importance of  fully functional actin cytoskeleton for vacuolar shaping during primary root cell elongation. In root epidermal late meristematic cells, actin stabilization (Jasplakinolide) results in larger main vacuoles while actin disruption (Latrunculin ) induces the appearance of  round and smaller main vacuole, especially in cells prior to rapid second cell elongation (Scheuring et al., 2016). However, Takatsuka et al. (2018) show that no striking vacuolar changes occur prior to the second elongation event, indicating that they do not seem to be its trigger. In summary, longitudinally oriented actin bundles and increased actin dynamics are indicative of primary root cell elongation. Importantly, actin filaments seem to have  crucial role in the second rapid cell expansion of root cells. Why are these bundled and active filaments necessary for cell elongation in the root? Likely there are two important factors: First, actin TABLE  | Inhibitor effect on root growth, cell expansion, vacuolar shape, and actin organization and dynamics.

Garc -Gonz lez and van Gelderen Actin and Primary Root Growth Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org  December 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 777119 filaments help to deliver cell wall remodeling components to the growing sides of the cell. There is  clear link between actin myosin-mediated cytoplasmic streaming, endomembrane remodeling, and cell growth, suggesting that the organization of actin parallel to the growth axis could aid cell elongation by increasing delivery of endocytic cargoes (Peremyslov et al., 2012; Tominaga et al., 2013). Second, there is the plant-specific need to regulate  growing cells  turgor pressure, which could be mediated by the vacuolar network. Root cell elongation is inversely correlated to vacuolar constriction and the two are tightly depending on specific actin organization and dynamics. However, the connection between vacuolar occupancy, actin, and root growth should be explored in more detail. THE ROLE OF ACTIN ISOFORMS AND ACTIN-BINDING PROTEINS IN PRIMARY ROOT GROWTH The actin cytoskeleton consists of actin filaments made up of strands of -actin polymers of different isoforms, depending on the cell type, tissue, or specific cellular function. Proteins that bind to, interact with, and modify actin filaments to coordinate their orientation and dynamics, are crucial for the operation of the actin cytoskeleton. Actin nucleators promote de novo or branched filament assembly; actin-capping/severing proteins regulate the dynamics of actin filaments by mediating its turnover; network protein (NET) family members link actin and the endomembrane system; myosin motor proteins facilitate actin-based vesicle and organ motility. In the next section, we dissect which particular isoforms of actin are crucial for root growth and we discuss how and why various actin-binding proteins affect root growth. Actin -actin is  highly conserved protein that is encoded by eight functional genes in plants. They can be classified, based on their sequence and temporal and spatial expression pattern, into two major groups: reproductive (ACT1, ACT3, ACT4, ACT11, and ACT12) and vegetative (ACT2, ACT7, and ACT8). The first class is expressed in pollen, ovules, and seeds while the second class is expressed in vegetative tissues, including some of the floral organs (.., petals, sepals, and carpel) and germinating seeds. All vegetative actins were observed to be strongly expressed in young roots (McDowell et al., 1996; Reviewed in Meagher et al., 1999, 2000;  lajcherov  et al., 2012). Of the vegetative actins, ACT7 seems most involved in shaping primary root growth, because act7 mutants have severe root elongation phenotypes and wavier roots (Gilliland et al., 2003; Kandasamy et al., 2009). At the tissue level, act7 had  reduction in cell number in the proximal meristem zone and an increase in cell number in the transition zone (Takatsuka et al., 2018). Actin organization analysis in act7 showed  delayed onset of longitudinal actin bundling at the boundary between the elongation and transition zones as observed in wild-type plants. This points to ACT7 as the main player in the second rapid cell elongation (Table ; Kandasamy et al., 2009; Takatsuka et al., 2018). The other two vegetative actin isoforms (ACT2 and ACT8) seem to have  more relevant role in root hair formation and only show root elongation phenotypes in dominant-negative mutants (act2-2D and frz1, respectively; Nishimura et al., 2003; Kandasamy et al., 2009; Kato et al., 2010). Only when both isoforms are knocked out, the phenotype of act7 mutants could be mimicked, suggesting  secondary role of ACT2 and ACT8 in root cell elongation (Table ) (Takatsuka et al., 2018). Consistent with phenotypical observations, act7- and not act2 act8 mutants show decreased vacuolar fragmentation in late meristematic epidermal cells, consistent with actin stabilization treatment by Jasplakinolide. This failure to regulate proper vacuolar constraining probably contributes to  delay in the initiation of fast cell elongation (Scheuring et al., 2016). The wavier root phenotypes observed in act7- and der1- (carrying an ACT2 point mutation) mutants correlate with the higher presence of oblique cell walls, also pointing to  role of these two isoforms in cytokinesis (Gilliland et al., 2003; Va kebov  et al., 2018). Actin-Binding Proteins Actin Nucleators and Actin Crosslinker/Bundling Proteins Actin nucleators promote de novo or branched filament assembly from available actin monomers or profilin-bound -actin. The actin nucleators most relevant to main root growth are the actin-binding proteins belonging to the ARP2/ complex and formins. The ARP2/ complex is formed by seven subunits that are ubiquitously expressed throughout plant development (Klahre and Chua, 1999; Le et al., 2003; Li et al., 2003; Mathur et al., 2003; El-Assal et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2013a; Garc - Gonz lez et al., 2020). Based on similarity to animal models, the ARP2/ complex is hypothesized to participate in actin filament nucleation and branching. Although some of its subunits have been shown to colocalize with actin-branching sites, its function is yet to be demonstrated in planta (Fi erov  et al., 2006). Other studies link the function of ARP2/ to actin- microtubule interplay (Zhang et al., 2013a; Havelkov  et al., 2015; Cifrov  et al., 2020). The lack of functional ARP2/ complex subunits or its activators results in  reduction of primary root growth rate, accompanied by less cell divisions in the meristematic zone, more cells in the transition zone, and  shorter elongation zone (Dyachok et al., 2008, 2011; Takatsuka et al., 2018). The ARP2/ complex requires upstream activation by the SCAR/WAVE complex (Reviewed in Yanagisawa et al., 2013). The SCAR/WAVE complex subunits BRK1 and SCAR1 were observed in the root tip epidermis up until the elongation zone, mainly in three-way cell junctions. brk1 and arp3 mutants show disorganized actin arrays in the elongation zone (Dyachok et al., 2011). Furthermore, the SCAR/WAVE complex seems to be involved in cell wall deposition in three-way junctions of root epidermal cells (Dyachok et al., 2008). Taken together, the actin pool coordinated by the ARP2/ complex and its activators participate in the second rapid cell expansion at the boundary of the transition and elongation zones,\n\nGarc -Gonz lez and van Gelderen Actin and Primary Root Growth Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org  December 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 777119 presumably through its contribution to correct cell wall modification (Table ). Formins are actin-binding proteins responsible for de novo actin nucleation, actin filament elongation and bundling. In angiosperms, two groups of formins exist, encoded by  total of 21 genes. Typically, class  formins are associated with membranes, while class II are cytoplasmic (Grunt et al., 2008; Reviewed in Cvr kov , 2012, 2013). The knowledge on the role of formins in root growth is scarce; however, it indicates  role in vesicle trafficking and endomembrane remodeling (Table ). Class  formins FH1, FH4, and FH8 are expressed in roots (Deeks et al., 2005; Oulehlov  et al., 2019). In particular, FH1 subcellular localization has been reported to vary according to the developmental stage in epidermal root cells. In the meristematic zone, FH1-GFP accumulates to cell plates of dividing cells and anticlinal walls. In the transition zone, plasmodesmata and tonoplast-associated FH1-GFP can be observed, while the signal is progressively lost toward the elongation and maturation zone. free, mobile fraction of FH1-GFP dots could be observed throughout root cell development, which are likely associated with late endosomes (Oulehlov  et al., 2019). Although fh1 plants do not show  clear root elongation phenotype unless treated with Latrunculin ,  phenomenon very likely due to functional redundancy of formins. Latrunculin  treatment causes an increase in bundling and  decrease in actin dynamics, especially in the differentiation zone (Rosero et al., 2013). Microtubule dynamics are also affected in the fh1 mutant, indicating again the importance of the crosstalk between actin and microtubules (Rosero et al., 2013). Furthermore, these data suggest  role of FH1 in regulating root cell elongation through the maintenance of endomembrane system dynamics.",

Microtubule dynamics are also affected in the fh1 mutant, indicating again the importance of the crosstalk between actin and microtubules (Rosero et al., 2013). Furthermore, these data suggest  role of FH1 in regulating root cell elongation through the maintenance of endomembrane system dynamics. FH8 is expressed mainly in the root meristem, and its subcellular localization is in the nucleus in interphase cells and in the phragmoplast during cytokinesis, suggesting  role of FH8 in cell division. fh8 mutant plants have no reduced root growth phenotype, except for an increased sensitivity to Latrunculin  treatment (Xue et al., 2011), similar to the fh1 mutant. The absence of  clear phenotype in fh8 mutants does not exclude the possibility of  role of this formin in root growth, as suggested by expression data. Another class  formin, FH5, has also been observed to participate in cytokinesis in root meristematic cells (Ingouff et al., 2005). These cases highlight the importance of breaking genetic redundancy in these sizeable protein families. Class II formins have been less studied regarding root growth. double null mutant allele of the RMD formin has shorter elongation zone cells accompanied by an increased amount of transversally arranged actin bundles. This results in  wavy root phenotype and reduced root growth rate (Li et al., 2014). In the double RMD formin mutant, increased persistence of FM4-64-labeled and OsPIN2 BFA bodies after treatment washout showed that endomembrane vesicle trafficking was impaired in this mutant (Li et al., 2014). Actin-Capping/Severing Proteins Villins are versatile calcium-responsive actin-binding proteins that can modify actin dynamics by depolymerizing, capping, severing, and bundling actin filaments. Arabidopsis thaliana encodes five villin paralogs which are widely expressed (Klahre et al., 2000; Khurana et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2010; Reviewed in Huang et al., 2015). Although no root elongation phenotypes have been reported for villin mutants, VLN2, VLN3, and VLN4 have been shown to be facilitators of actin turnover and bundling in epidermal root cells (Table ). The double mutant vln2 vln3 shows twisted roots and vln4 has altered root bending upon gravistimulation (van der Honing et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2019). It is possible that higher-order mutants are needed to unveil  role of villins in primary root length determination, but the above-mentioned defects in root bending and twisting of villin mutants indicates that they are required for the fine tuning of root directional growth (van der Honing et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2019). ADF/cofilins are  family of actin-binding proteins that promote depolymerization, severing and bundling of actin filaments. There are 11 ADF genes that can be divided into two subfamilies: -type ADFs with depolymerizing activities (ADF1-, ADF6-, and ADF10-11) and -type ADFs with bundling activity (ADF5 and ADF9; Nan et al., 2017). Expression analysis of the members of this family has shown that all ADFs except ADF7 and ADF10 are expressed in root tissues of which ADF1, ADF5, and ADF6 in the vasculature, ADF5 and ADF9 in the RAM and ADF8 and ADF11 in trichoblasts (Dong et al., 2001a; Kandasamy et al., 2007; Ruzicka et al., 2007). ADF1 overexpression induced shorter roots, consistent with the phenotype observed when plants are treated with actin-depolymerizing drugs such as Latrunculin . In contrast, reduced expression of ADF1 resulted in longer roots. Research in hypocotyls showed an increase of actin bundling in mutants with decreased ADF1 expression (Dong et al., 2001b). ADF2- RNAi lines show increased actin density and bundling in roots but no visible root phenotype other than an occasional reduction in root apical meristem size, similar to the effect obtained with the actin-stabilizing drug Jasplakinolide (Cl ment et al., 2009). Once more, ADF genetic redundancy may be the key to the lack of observable root phenotypes in knockout mutants, but the increase in actin bundling and density in the respective mutants suggests that ADF1 and ADF2 specifically are involved in increasing actin turnover in root epidermis. This is  hint of their function in root elongation; however, more research is needed to uncover the importance of other ADFs in this process. ACTIN INTERACTING PROTEIN  (AIP1) is facilitating the activity of ADF/cofilin proteins and has  function in capping the barbed end of actin filaments (Ketelaar et al., 2004). Consistent with the effect observed by drugs like Cytochalasin , AIP1-RNAi lines show reduced root growth accompanied by  general increase in actin bundling (Ketelaar et al., 2004). Downregulation of AIP1 expression leads to reduced FM4-64 internalization comparable to the effect observed after Jasplakinolide treatment. The phenotype observed is possibly  consequence of actin filament stabilization (Dhonukshe et al., 2008).

Profilins belong to  multigene family and can be divided into two main groups: vegetative (PRF1  PRF3) and reproductive (PRF4 and PRF5; Kandasamy et al., 2002). The vegetative profilin gene PRF1 has higher promoter activity in the elongation zone (Ramachandran et al., 2000). Analysis of prf1 knockout lines resulted in contradicting root length phenotypes that overall indicate  role for PRF1 in regulating root growth (Ramachandran et al., 2000; McKinney et al., 2001;  ssar et al., 2015; Cao et al., 2016). The prf3 mutant has no observable root growth phenotype and overexpression of PRF3 induces either WT-like or shorter roots (Fan et al., 2013;  ssar et al., 2015). PRF1 was shown to maintain actin filament density in elongation zone root epidermal cells (Cao et al., 2016). Analysis of actin dynamics in hypocotyl cells suggests  role of PRF1 in the positive regulation of actin turnover through the facilitation of nucleation of other actin pools through formin activity (Cao et al., 2016). Though, it is likely that different profilins regulate the dynamics of distinct pools of actin, therefore producing different phenotypes. Actin-Membrane Binding Proteins The network (NET) family of proteins are linkers between actin and the endomembrane system. They are characterized by the presence of  conserved -actin-binding domain in the -terminal region. Several members of this family have been described to connect the actin cytoskeleton to different membrane compartments; however, the exact mechanism of NET proteins action to modulate the actin cytoskeleton remains to be determined (Deeks et al., 2012; Reviewed in Wang and Hussey, 2015). NET1A and NET1B connect -actin to the plasma membrane and plasmodesmata. Both are expressed in the root meristem and early elongation zone and the double knockout mutant net1a net1b has shorter roots (Deeks et al., 2012). NET4 is localized to the tonoplast and is also expressed in the root meristem and early elongation zone. While net4a net4b show no root growth phenotype, NET4A overexpression induces shorter roots. Both mutants display higher cellular vacuolar occupancy. However, net4a net4b show  more fragmented vacuolar network than NET4A-GFPOE, reminiscent of the effect obtained by Latrunculin  and Jasplakinolide treatment (.., depolymerization and stabilization of actin, respectively). Increase in NET4 expression leads to more constricted vacuoles and failure to establish the onset of cell elongation. Higher amounts of NET4 are present in the late meristematic/transition zone, correlating with regions of high vacuolar constrictions (Scheuring et al., 2016; Kaiser et al., 2019). These results again indicate the impact of actin on vacuolar occupancy and consequently on root growth. Motor Proteins Myosins are actin-binding motor proteins with multiple roles, mainly known for their role in vesicle and organelle motility. Increasing evidence also points to their involvement in the control of actin organization and dynamics. Two myosin families have been described in angiosperms: myosin VIII, which are found at the cell cortex presumably creating tension through actin, and myosin XI which are intracellular and colocalize with several organelles, some of unknown identity (Reviewed in Ryan and Nebenf hr, 2018). Triple myosin mutants in Arabidopsis (xi-//, xi3ko for short) have reduced hypocotyl and root growth. Specifically, roots have shorter cells at the elongation zone accompanied by  less dense, more bundled, and randomly oriented actin. This coincides with  failure of the xi3ko mutant to coordinate constriction of the vacuole in late meristem cells, similar to the above-mentioned act7- mutant or the NET4-GFPOE overexpressing mutants (Scheuring et al., 2016; Kaiser et al., 2019). Also, actin dynamics are slowed down with less severing frequency which probably leads to  reduced vesicle delivery (Peremyslov et al., 2010; Reviewed in Zhu and Geisler, 2015). This correlates with the results obtained in previous studies using the myosin inhibitor BDM and further confirms the importance of myosin XI in regulating actin dynamics and cell elongation ( amaj et al., 2000).",

This correlates with the results obtained in previous studies using the myosin inhibitor BDM and further confirms the importance of myosin XI in regulating actin dynamics and cell elongation ( amaj et al., 2000). In summary, all the components of the actin network, including actin monomers themselves, have  high degree of functional redundancy and functional specialization. Therefore, it is not always straightforward to draw conclusions on their effects on the regulation of root growth. However, in many cases overexpression, silencing, or knockout of actin components seems to reduce root growth, except for ADF1 knockout, which increases root length. This suggests that disrupting the actin network often has  detrimental effect, considering that different actin-modifying proteins have various effects on actin organization (see Table ). However, superficially similar effects can also be masked by effects of actin organization in vacuolar size and occupancy, or by effects on hormone trafficking, which will be discussed in the next section. HORMONAL REGULATION OF ACTIN- MEDIATED PRIMARY ROOT GROWTH Primary root growth plasticity depends on the very tight balance between cell division, cell elongation, and cell differentiation. The rapid adjustment to new stimuli is mediated by the coordinated action of  complex network of plant hormones. However, as the previous sections showed, the actin cytoskeleton also plays an important role here. Often hormones lead to changes in actin, and actin changes lead to differences in hormone distribution. In this section, we focus on the role of the actin cytoskeleton in hormonal control of primary root growth, and especially the role of auxin, the most-studied hormone in this context. The Auxin-Actin Feedback Loop Modulates Root Development Auxin is the most studied and important plant hormone in relation to the regulation of the actin network in the context of main root growth. Changes in the actin network have\n\nGarc -Gonz lez and van Gelderen Actin and Primary Root Growth Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org  December 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 777119 strong effect on polar auxin transport. Conversely, auxin has  significant effect on the actin cytoskeleton itself (Reviewed in Zhu and Geisler, 2015; Zhu et al., 2016; Sahi et al., 2018; Zou et al., 2019; Arieti and Staiger, 2020). The actin cytoskeleton response to auxin has been predominantly analyzed in the root epidermis transition and elongation zones, as this hormone is strongly involved in root cell elongation during root growth and tropic responses. Actin inhibitor studies have shown that Cytochalasin  or Latrunculin  treatment alters the plasma membrane distribution of the auxin efflux carriers PIN1 and PIN3, which are key regulators of tropic growth (Geldner et al., 2001; Friml et al., 2002). Conversely, auxin treatment is known to inhibit root growth and cell elongation (Table ; Evans et al., 1994; Rahman et al., 2007; Fendrych et al., 2018). Initial studies with the native auxin Indole--Acetic-Acid (IAA) reported contradicting effects on actin filament bundling (Rahman et al., 2007; Nick et al., 2009; Lanza et al., 2012; Takahashi et al., 2017). The differences between these studies suggest that precise concentration, duration, form of auxin, and root cell developmental status appear to be an important driver of actin changes. However, detailed quantitative analysis of IAA treatment reported  significative increase in density, unbundling, and higher organization of actin filaments in elongating cells of the root, which is generally maintained even after 60 min of treatment (Figure ; Table ; Lanza et al., 2012; Arieti and Staiger, 2020). These changes in actin organization, induced by IAA treatment, are consistent with the general trend that less bundled actin filaments are associated with less cell elongation. The synthetic auxin -Naphtalene-Acetic-Acid (NAA) was suggested to inhibit root growth through the actin-mediated increase of vacuolar constriction in late meristematic cells. Consistent with this hypothesis, vacuoles of plants pre-treated with actin-disrupting drugs show less sensitivity to external auxin (Table ; Scheuring et al., 2016). The auxin analog ,-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (,-) affects root growth through the inhibition of both cell division and cell elongation (Table ; Rahman et al., 2007). Unlike IAA, ,- effects mimic those of the actin-depolymerizing drug Latrunculin  (Figure ). ,- treatment disturbs auxin signaling via  different ubiquitin ligase complex than IAA, the SMAP1-SCFTIR1 complex, thereby affecting post-translational modifications of actin (Rodr guez- Serrano et al., 2014; Takahashi et al., 2017). Each auxin analog employed in the above-mentioned studies differentially affects auxin signaling, which allows us to pinpoint the molecular mechanism of auxin-dependent actin responses (Ma and Robert, 2014). Auxin can also affect the actin cytoskeleton via the activation of transcription: promoter activity of the vegetative actin ACT7 and transcription of several subunits of the actin nucleator ARP2/ complex are enhanced by auxin treatment (Kandasamy et al., 2001; Garc -Gonz lez et al., 2020). feedback loop exists between auxin signaling and the actin cytoskeleton: treatment with the auxin transport inhibitor naphthylphthalamic acid (NPA) inhibits root growth by reducing cell division rate and induces  reduction in actin filament density (Rahman et al., 2007). In hypocotyls, NPA treatment leads to an increase in actin filament bundling and  decrease in actin bundle density in hypocotyl cells, without disturbing long actin filaments. Plants lacking the actin isoform ACT7 (act7-) are insensitive to NPA treatment (Zhu et al., 2016). Moreover, actin seems to be required for the correct expression, localization, and trafficking of auxin carriers. act7- mutants have reduced expression of ABCB transporters, altered localization of PIN1 and PIN2, and increased endosomal retention of auxin transporters (Zhu et al., 2016). The wavy phenotype of act2- lines is connected to the delocalization from the plasma membrane of PIN2 (Lanza et al., 2012). When treated with Latrunculin , PIN2 accumulates into intracellular vesicles and disappears largely from the plasma membrane (Kleine-Vehn et al., 2009; Glanc et al., 2019). These results indicate the importance of the actin network on the trafficking of hormone transporters. Other actin-binding protein mutants, such as the rice class II formin RMD and VILLIN4, show reduced polar auxin transport in roots (Li et al., 2014; Zou et al., 2019). Furthermore, the expression of the above-mentioned RMD gene in rice is facilitated by the action of the TIR/AFB1 pathway- dependent OsARF23 and OsARF24 (Li et al., 2014). Further work revealed that the auxin influx carrier AUX1 was necessary to mediate the actin filament response triggered by auxin treatment in roots (Arieti and Staiger, 2020). It appears that auxin and actin are very much interlinked via the control of polar auxin transport by actin dynamics, or via the direct or transcriptional effects of auxin on the same actin dynamics. Exactly how these two important players feedback on each other and create coordinated development and tropisms is still  topic with many questions. Especially interesting is the mechanistic connection between the intracellular transport of vesicles containing auxin transporters and the status of the actin network, or the way in which auxin sensing is quickly translated into changes in the actin network. Other Hormones Besides auxin, other hormones have been connected to actin organization during primary root growth, although they have been studied with less depth. For instance, brassinosteroid treatment induces  wavy phenotype that correlates with an increase of finer, shorter and more dynamic actin filaments in epidermal cells (Lanza et al., 2012). The observed phenotypes are comparable to those resulting from ACT2 mutation. Furthermore, both brassinosteroid treatment and act2- mutation result in PIN2 delocalization in the root epidermis. This suggests that brassinosteroids, auxin, and actin have  shared pathway regulating root waving (Table ; Lanza et al., 2012). Cytokinin treatment decreases root growth via  reduction in meristem size (Ioio et al., 2007;   ka et al., 2009; Takatsuka et al., 2018). Cytokinin has  negative effect on auxin signaling through its inhibition in the transition zone (Figure ; Reviewed in Vanstraelen and Benkov , 2012; Takatsuka and Umeda, 2014; Wybouw and De Rybel, 2019). The response to cytokinin is mediated through the modulation of the actin cytoskeleton at the boundary between the transition and elongation zone, as observed by an increase in actin bundling and  decrease in actin filament density after treatment (Takatsuka et al., 2018). Also, an increase in cytokinin was shown to disrupt the\n\nGarc -Gonz lez and van Gelderen Actin and Primary Root Growth Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 10 December 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 777119 longitudinal rearrangement of actin filaments in roots, in agreement with the tendency of longitudinally organized actin bundles to induce root growth (Kushwah et al., 2011). The actin cytoskeleton seems to be  nexus in mediating the complex responses to auxin during root growth. Generally, auxin tends to induce more longitudinally organized and less bundled filaments, while cytokinin tends to induce an increase in bundling and less organized actin filaments. Current models suggest that there is  cytokinin-dependent generation of an auxin minimum starting at the transition zone (Reviewed in Rutten and Tusscher, 2019). This hormone gradient correlates with the start of cell elongation and the increase in actin organization toward  more bundled and longitudinally oriented network in the elongation zone. Failure to generate the proper hormone gradients results in growth inhibition. Exactly how hormone gradients lead to changes in actin filament organization is not very clear. In the case of auxin and cytokinin it is likely auxin, which has the terminal effect, while cytokinin controls the auxin gradient. This notion could be tested by tissue-specific inhibition of cytokinin signaling to disturb the auxin gradient. However, only the systematic and comparative analysis of actin organization in specific cell types in response to the manipulation of hormonal pathways will unveil the existing interdependence in cytoskeletal control. Furthermore, the involvement of specific actin-binding proteins downstream of hormone signaling would contribute to understanding which actin organization and dynamics modifications are more relevant. Auxin and cytokinin are also very important for the regulation of root tropisms. This is the stage for another interaction between hormones and actin, which we will discuss next. ACTIN CONTROL OF PRIMARY ROOT TROPISMS AND LIGHT RESPONSE Root plasticity relies on the ability of the root to direct its growth toward or against  stimulus. For the primary root tip this is achieved mostly through asymmetric cell expansion that allows for its bending. Mainly two tropisms have been studied in relation to actin: positive gravitropism and negative phototropism. In both cases actin is involved in both stimuli perception and response. Gravitropism Primary root directional growth is  multistep process that goes from gravity sensing to signal transduction and response execution. The gravity vector is sensed by sedimenting statoliths which results in the relocalization of PIN auxin transporters and  differential auxin gradient, causing differential growth of cells between top and bottom of the root tip (Reviewed in Su et al., 2017). Statoliths are amyloplasts functioning in gravity perception and sediment in the central columella cells when the root orientation changes. This sedimentation has been recognized as the primary process controlling gravity perception (Sack, 1997; Reviewed in Nakamura et al., 2019). fine network of -actin surrounds statoliths in central columella cells.",

    "text": "This is the stage for another interaction between hormones and actin, which we will discuss next. ACTIN CONTROL OF PRIMARY ROOT TROPISMS AND LIGHT RESPONSE Root plasticity relies on the ability of the root to direct its growth toward or against  stimulus. For the primary root tip this is achieved mostly through asymmetric cell expansion that allows for its bending. Mainly two tropisms have been studied in relation to actin: positive gravitropism and negative phototropism. In both cases actin is involved in both stimuli perception and response. Gravitropism Primary root directional growth is  multistep process that goes from gravity sensing to signal transduction and response execution. The gravity vector is sensed by sedimenting statoliths which results in the relocalization of PIN auxin transporters and  differential auxin gradient, causing differential growth of cells between top and bottom of the root tip (Reviewed in Su et al., 2017). Statoliths are amyloplasts functioning in gravity perception and sediment in the central columella cells when the root orientation changes. This sedimentation has been recognized as the primary process controlling gravity perception (Sack, 1997; Reviewed in Nakamura et al., 2019). fine network of -actin surrounds statoliths in central columella cells. The results from actin cytoskeleton inhibitors and knockout mutants of the actin network components show that -actin is involved in the regulation of statolith repositioning (Figure ; White and Sack, 1990; Balu ka and Hasenstein, 1997; Volkmann et al., 1999; Voigt et al., 2005; Reviewed in Blancaflor, 2013). Actin disruption by Latrunculin  or Cytochalasin  and the inhibition of myosin activity by BDM enhance root tip bending to gravity, while the actin- stabilizers Jasplakinolide or phalloidin inhibit the gravitropic response (Hou et al., 2003; Li et al., 2005; Mancuso et al., 2006). Latrunculin  treatment results in faster statolith relocalization which indicates that the fine actin network fine-tunes statolith movement and repositioning after gravistimulus (Hou et al., 2003; Zheng et al., 2015). To date, the only actin-binding protein that has been connected to statolith sedimentation and PIN relocalization during the root gravitropic response is the ARP2/ complex (Reboulet et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2015; Zou et al., 2016). Knock-out of the ARP2/ subunit ARP3 leads to  slower gravitropic response which is associated with reduced statolith sedimentation and an increase in actin bundling around statoliths (Reboulet et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2015; Zou et al., 2016). The E3 ubiquitin ligase SGR9 mediates at least part of the interaction between the actin network and statoliths. Plants lacking SGR9 show impaired statolith sedimentation resulting in  reduced gravitropic response, accompanied by an abnormal actin filament network around statoliths. This phenotype could be rescued by the application of the actin-depolymerizing drug Latrunculin , suggesting  role of SGR9 in releasing statoliths from the actin cytoskeleton through its interactors (Nakamura et al., 2011). These experiments studied the statoliths in the endodermis of the inflorescence stem and not in roots. However, the mechanism of gravity perception between roots and shoots is likely to be very comparable at the statolith level. Further work should elucidate whether the same mechanism exists in roots. Additionally, it would be interesting to know which actin-binding proteins interact with SGR9. Experiments with decapped roots, laser ablation of columella cells, starch-less mutants, or maintaining the root cap at  specific angle suggest an alternative gravisensing mechanism at the distal elongation zone, out of the root cap (Wolverton et al., 2002, 2011; Mancuso et al., 2006). Our combined knowledge points to  significant role of actin in gravity perception via the mediation of statolith sedimentation. However, the actin cytoskeleton has also been proposed to mediate PIN3 relocalization to the lateral plasma membrane in columella cells upon gravistimulation. PIN3 clathrin-mediated endocytosis is naturally increased when seedlings are re-oriented,  phenomenon that can be enhanced by Latrunculin  treatment (Friml et al., 2002; Kleine-Vehn et al., 2010). This represents  connection between actin and gravity signal transduction through the regulation of the asymmetric redistribution of auxin. It is likely that actin is involved in the delivery of endocytic cargoes containing PIN3 to the plasma membrane. Further downstream, actin bundles could mediate the asymmetric growth of the root meristem during the gravitropic response. Although  change toward more oblique oriented microfilaments has been observed in stele\n\nGarc -Gonz lez and van Gelderen Actin and Primary Root Growth Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 11 December 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 777119 cells upon gravistimulation, no clear correlation between actin organization in epidermal cells and root asymmetric growth has been determined (Blancaflor, 2002; Pozhvanov et al., 2013). Evidence in support of  direct role of actin in the asymmetric cell growth of the root tip is the observations that vesicle trafficking is defective in root epidermal cells of various actin and actin-binding protein mutants (Li et al., 2014; Mao et al., 2016; Zou et al., 2016; Oulehlov  et al., 2019). The process of root-negative phototropism, where the root tip bends away from  blue or red light source, is also partly regulated via actin, since it is regulated via the same auxin transporters as gravitropism (Wan et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2013b). In summary, actin has  role in the sedimentation and repositioning of statoliths which determines the strength of gravity perception. It is not yet clear to what extent the -actin network is responsible for relaying the mechanical signal of sedimenting statoliths to  differential PIN distribution and gravitropic growth. Effects of Light on Actin Organization in Roots The processes of gravitropism and root growth in general are heavily influenced by light perception (Silva-Navas et al., 2016). When  seedling is exposed to light, hypocotyl growth is reduced, cotyledons open and make chlorophyll, while root length growth strongly increases. Seedlings growing fully in darkness have  strongly reduced root growth (Sassi et al., 2012). Actin filaments in elongating root cells are normally vertically oriented and bundled. However, in darkness, actin oriented seemingly randomly, with less bundling, and less alignment (Dyachok et al., 2011). Furthermore, it has been shown that PRF1 is important for root growth and development during photomorphogenesis (McKinney et al., 2001). Even though roots normally grow covered from light in the soil, Arabidopsis roots express all types of common photoreceptors in plants, including the Far-Red light sensor PHYA (Reviewed in van Gelderen et al., 2018). Seedling roots grown in Far-Red light have  bundled actin organization, mostly resembling growth in white light, but in  phyA mutant, actin organization was more resembling that of dark-grown seedlings (Dyachok et al., 2011). This is an example of  direct link between light perception and actin organization in roots. However, most studies focus on the effects of light quality and quantity in above ground tissues, such as the hypocotyl epidermis (Henty et al., 2011) or stomatal guard cells (Iwabuchi et al., 2010). Current standard growth conditions keep roots exposed to light, but roots have not evolved to grow exposed to light and therefore efforts have been made in the past years to grow Arabidopsis roots in the dark, while keeping the shoot in light. notable example of this is the -root system, which is simply  dark cover around  square agar plate to shield the root from light, with an added insert at the shoot-root boundary (Silva-Navas et al., 2015). This system showed that covering the roots leads to increased root growth and less free radical production compared to the roots exposed to light (Silva-Navas et al., 2016). Using an alternative root shading method to -root it was demonstrated that components of the SCAR/WAVE-ARP2/ system BRK1 and SCAR1 are involved in regulating root growth in covered roots (Dyachok et al., 2011). The subcellular localization of BRK1-YFP changes from occurring at three-way junctions of cells to cytoplasmic upon darkness. SCAR1 is reduced in protein extracts from both soluble and membrane extract, and the central light regulator COP1 is involved in SCAR1 degradation (Dyachok et al., 2011). Therefore, it seems clear that actin has  significant role to play in the regulation of root growth by light. However, very little work has been done until now to further explore this connection. It is also of especial importance to do this in systems such as -root to simulate the light conditions of the soil in order to obtain results that are relevant for plant growth in field or natural conditions. CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE PERSPECTIVE The actin network has been studied for  long time and there is  relatively large body of earlier work on the role of actin in regulating root growth. In the recent  years, this work has been revisited and expanded upon (Abu-Abied et al., 2018; Takatsuka et al., 2018; Oulehlov  et al., 2019; Arieti and Staiger, 2020; de Bang et al., 2020). Although this sometimes led to contradictory or incomplete findings, the actin network is essential for root growth by regulating cell elongation and division. main conclusion is that actin organization is developmentally regulated in the growing root tip. Bundled and longitudinally oriented actin filaments are  hallmark of cell elongation. Failure to achieve this arrangement by tampering with hormonal homeostasis or altering actin-binding protein function results in root growth defects. Most results with hormone and drug treatments and actin-binding protein mutants seem to correlate well with this general principle. These changes in actin organization affect cell growth in different ways, and of particular interest for further study is how actin-mediated delivery of cell wall modifying components aids cell elongation of the primary root meristem. There are also causal links between actin, vacuolar morphology, and cell elongation. However, more evidence is needed to show that defects in actin directly cause defects in vacuolar morphology that subsequently cause root growth defects. Knowledge in this field is lacking evidence on the role of actin-binding proteins in regulating the actin network with regard to growth and development of the root meristem. In general, actin-binding proteins are well studied, however, with respect to root growth, there is little data available on phenotypic effects, usually due to  high degree of genetic redundancy. Overexpression often leads to detrimental effects on root growth, while single or even double mutants do not. With recent advances in CRISPR multiplexing, this redundancy problem can be tackled efficiently and the roles of actin- binding proteins in root growth and development can and should be elucidated. Hormonal regulation of primary root growth occurs mainly through the coordination between auxin and cytokinin signaling, which contributes to the generation of developmental regions\n\nGarc -Gonz lez and van Gelderen Actin and Primary Root Growth Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 12 December 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 777119 with  specific actin organization. The role of auxins, cytokinins, and especially other hormones in the control of the actin cytoskeleton requires more future work. This work would be made easier by the consistent and more precise denomination of which root zones and cell layers are analyzed, in order to compare the effects of individual hormones and their combination in the control of the actin network. Related to this is the study of root gravitropism, where actin has several different functions. It is involved in the direct sensing of gravity, controls the propagation of the hormone signal and it is likely involved in the subsequent regulation of cell elongation. This study brings together three different roles for actin and is therefore  very interesting subfield, which will benefit by recent advances in live imaging. With vertically oriented confocal laser scanning microscopes it is possible to study root gravitropism in vivo in real time and see details and subtleties not imaged before. Another new way of studying actin will be to use new optogenetic tools that allow the direct manipulation of the cytoskeleton or cytoskeletal components (Zhang et al., 2021), which might provide  deeper understanding of how actin functions in regulating cell elongation in complex tissues such as the root. With these new possibilities it will be possible to subtly disturb the actin network while imaging it at the highest temporal and spatial resolution.

Boothbya, and Bob Goldsteina Our report () describing the discovery of extensive horizontal gene transfer in  tardigrade genome has raised questions from other groups who were se- quencing the Hypsibius dujardini genome in parallel or who have done new experiments and analyses since our report ( ). Bemm et al. () now report fil- tering our data for likely contaminants, resulting in  new, prefiltered genome assembly. Arakawa () has sequenced genomes of starved, washed, individual animals that had been treated with antibiotics for 48 , and used this genomic sequence and RNA-Seq data to identify likely bona fide tardigrade contigs. Two other reports have contributed data and analysis: Delmont and Eren () used  newly published analysis and visualization platform, Anvi  (), to identify likely contaminants in our genome assembly, and Koutsovoulos et al. () applied useful taxon-annotated GC coverage plots (Blobplots) () to our data and reported an inde- pendent genome assembly. Before discussing the robustness of our finding of extensive horizontal gene transfer in tardigrades, we first note that we mistakenly uploaded an outdated version of our assembly to public databases. This assembly was 252 Mb, larger than the 212.-Mb assembly that we had used in our report (), as pointed out correctly by others (). The 212.-Mb assembly used in our report is available at the link provided below. The originally uploaded 252-Mb assembly in- cludes  40 Mb of sequence that we had identified as microbial contamination (see methods detailed at  This mistake may have contributed to discrepancies and issues raised by others. For example, Bemm et al. () identified 39 Mb of untrusted assembly, sim- ilar to the  40 Mb we filtered. Similarly, Delmont and Eren () identified whole bacterial genomes in our 252-Mb assembly, which were already largely filtered out in our 212.-Mb assembly. We apologize to other groups for this mistake. central finding of our original report () is  high rate of foreign genes in the . dujardini genome, which has been argued by others ( ) to be an artifact of incomplete filtering of contaminating microbial se- quences. The availability of these other groups  inde- pendent assemblies and multiple filtering approaches [via -mer selection () or GC% and coverage ()] al- lows us to test the robustness of our conclusions. Because any metric used will have its own particular strengths and weaknesses, we used three different approaches: () employing the horizontal gene transfer (HGT) index (), (ii) identifying genes that align to pro- karyotic but not eukaryotic sequences, and (iii) identi- fying  base level of HGT, ..,  class   genes as defined by Crisp et al. (). Using the HGT index, we find that . .% of genes in these independent . dujardini assemblies appear foreign (Fig. 1A). Examination of genes with prokaryotic but not eukaryotic alignments resulted in the identification of 164 384 genes (Fig. 1B). Class  genes in various . dujardini assemblies range from .% to .% (Fig. 1C). For each of these metrics, the proportion and/or number of foreign genes found in . dujardini is substantially elevated compared with typical animals (Fig. ) ( 11). In favor of these foreign genes not being contam- inants is the fact that, in these independent assem- blies, most genes identified as foreign reside on scaffolds together with tardigrade genes. Further- more, foreign vs. tardigrade genes from these assem- blies are represented at similar proportions in the other assemblies. On the whole, these independent assemblies show robust coverage of scaffolds from genomic and RNAseq reads of four independent sequencing efforts [including cleaned, antibiotic-treated individuals ()] (Fig. ). If these genes of foreign origin are considered to be contaminants and their scaffolds are removed, the completeness and size of each as- sembly is severely affected. aDepartment of Biology, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC 27599 Author contributions: ... and .. designed research and wrote the paper.

The level of HGT that we infer remains higher than in most animals that have been tested (Fig. ), although not as high  level as we had originally concluded (). It has been suggested that many foreign genes in the . dujardini genome might not be functional or might be contaminants be- cause RNAseq reads do not map to some of these genes (, ). However, it is well documented in the literature that many HGT genes are expressed at low levels or, in some cases, are not expressed at all. For example, it is known that essentially the entire Wolbachia genome has been transferred into the genome of Drosophila ananassae, yet only  % (28/,206) of these hori- zontally acquired genes are transcribed at detectable levels (12). Follow-up investigations confirmed extensive HGT into the nu- clear genome of this Drosophila species but failed to detect bi- ologically relevant expression of any foreign genes (13, 14). Thus, although identification of an expressed foreign gene could be viewed as evidence in favor of HGT, lack of expression alone is not  criterion for disproving HGT. We speculated that HGT might be important for tardigrade biology, but we restricted our analysis to HGT rather than functional HGT (). The RNAseq datasets (, ) will aid in assessing potential functions of these genes. We acknowledge that different groups have concluded different proportions of HGT in the . dujardini genome and that different metrics will give different estimates for the proportion of foreign genes in the genome. We have our own concerns about some of the methods used by other groups to exclude genes from our assembly (see  but we appreciate that the work of multiple groups is moving the science forward rapidly. All genomes are iterations, and we fully expect that new data and new technologies will refine this genome much as they have for the human genome and others. The true proportion of HGT may well lie between the various current esti- mates and may best be resolved with new sequencing technologies and bioinformatic and phylogenetic approaches.

    "text": "RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access TNO1,  TGN-localized SNARE-interacting protein, modulates root skewing in Arabidopsis thaliana Rahul Roy1,, and Diane . Bassham1,,* Abstract Background: The movement of plant roots within the soil is key to their ability to interact with the environment and maximize anchorage and nutrient acquisition. Directional growth of roots occurs by  combination of sensing external cues, hormonal signaling and cytoskeletal changes in the root cells. Roots growing on slanted, impenetrable growth medium display  characteristic waving and skewing, and mutants with deviations in these phenotypes assist in identifying genes required for root movement. Our study identifies  role for  trans-Golgi network-localized protein in root skewing. Results: We found that Arabidopsis thaliana TNO1 (TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein),  putative tethering factor localized at the trans-Golgi network, affects root skewing. tno1 knockout mutants display enhanced root skewing and epidermal cell file rotation. Skewing of tno1 roots increases upon microtubule stabilization, but is insensitive to microtubule destabilization. Microtubule destabilization leads to severe defects in cell morphology in tno1 seedlings. Microtubule array orientation is unaffected in the mutant roots, suggesting that the increase in cell file rotation is independent of the orientation of microtubule arrays. Conclusions: We conclude that TNO1 modulates root skewing in  mechanism that is dependent on microtubules but is not linked to disruption of the orientation of microtubule arrays. In addition, TNO1 is required for maintenance of cell morphology in mature regions of roots and the base of hypocotyls. The TGN-localized SNARE machinery might therefore be important for appropriate epidermal cell file rotation and cell expansion during root growth. Keywords: trans-Golgi network, Root movement, Cell file rotation, Tethering factor, Microtubules Background Establishment of the root system of  plant is crucial for efficient anchorage and nutrient acquisition. Root devel- opment and architecture are well-studied [] but our understanding of how roots interact with soil components is still incomplete. This is due in part to the difficulty of visualizing roots as they move into the soil, although recent developments such as the GLO-Roots platform aid in imaging this process [, ]. Root growth into the sub- stratum presents multiple cues to the root tip such as mechanical obstacles, moisture and nutrient gradients. These cues are integrated and then signal downstream processes involving hormonal pathways and cell expan- sion []. This leads to  cumulative physiological response driving root movement and establishing the root architecture. Studying and simulating root movement and direc- tional growth in the laboratory on synthetic growth media has revealed distinct movement types, and some of the genes and pathways that control them []. Roots of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings display various growth behaviors depending on external conditions. When em- bedded in  homogeneous medium (penetrable agar), roots grow downward in response to gravity and show minimal deviation from the gravity vector. By contrast, when roots are subjected to multiple directional cues, complicated growth patterns occur [].

This arises due to  com- bination of touch [], gravitropism [], circumnutation [], and physical interaction between the root tip and the growth medium []. Skewing and waving roots display  characteristic twisting of epidermal cell files along the root, referred to as cell file rotation (CFR). When roots of Arabidopsis seedlings skew and wave, the succession of sinusoidal waves alternate between left-handed and right-handed CFRs, which correlates with their rightward and leftward movement respectively [, ]. According to Rutherford and Masson (1996), skewing is described as rightward or leftward when viewed from the back of the plate [] while handedness of the CFR is defined as left-handed or right-handed when viewing the axis of the root point- ing shootwards. Roots of Arabidopsis grown on  slanted, hard medium exhibit  dominant left-handed rotation around the growth axis resulting in  predomin- antly counterclockwise/left-handed epidermal CFR. This usually corresponds to  rightward skewing when seen from the back of the plate [, , 10]. CFR also typically correlates with an oblique microtubule (MT) array orientation in the twisting cell files, although exceptions do exist [11]. Multiple factors such as external cues (.. moisture, light or gravity), hormonal pathways, and cytoskeletal and cell wall dynamics influence the direction of root growth []. External cues signal changes in hormone signaling pathways, including auxin [12 14], ethylene [, 15], cyto- kinin [16] and brassinosteroid pathways [17]. Downstream of hormonal and environmental perception, changes in the cytoskeleton and in cell wall deposition patterns modulate cell division and cell expansion dynamics, thus mediating root movements. Defects in tubulin structure or activity or in MT-associated proteins result in altered MT dynamics and array orientation. This then leads to changes in cell expansion and affects CFR and skewing [18, 19]. Cell wall properties and the trafficking of cell wall components to the plasma membrane are key to root elongation and movement as inferred from the altered root movements observed in mutants defective in cellu- lose deposition, wall-anchored proteins or crosslinking of cell wall components [20 22]. Sorting of cell wall components occurs at the trans- Golgi network (TGN),  tubulo-vesicular organelle that matures from the two or three trans- most cisternae of the Golgi [23]. It acts as an early endosome, receiving endocytosed cargo as well as directing vacuolar and secretory traffic, with distinct subdomains that function in various trafficking routes [24 30]. Specific membrane fusion factors called SNAREs (soluble -ethylmaleimide  sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) maintain vesicle trafficking fidelity and cargo sorting within cells [31]. The TGN-localized SYP4 (41/42/43) SNARE family is required for multiple transport pathways that in turn regulate auxin homeostasis and disease resistance [30]. SYP61, another TGN-localized SNARE that interacts with SYP41, functions in vacuolar trafficking and secretion of cell wall enzymes such as cellulose synthase and pectin- polysaccharide-modifying protein. This indicates  role for SYP61 in trafficking of cell wall components and enzymes for their synthesis and modification [32 34]. TNO1 (TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein) is  TGN- localized coiled-coil protein that interacts with the SYP41 SNARE machinery. Mutant plants lacking TNO1 (tno1) partially mis-sort vacuolar cargo, mis-localize SYP61 and display altered TGN dynamics and slower gravitropic responses [35, 36]. Trafficking at the TGN plays  role in auxin responses, trafficking of cell wall components, and cell expansion, all of which are important for root growth and move- ment. In addition, gravitropic bending is delayed in tno1 roots, suggesting defects in directional growth of roots. We therefore investigated  potential function for TNO1 in root movement. We report here that TNO1 acts as  negative regulator of root skewing, since tno1 mutant roots have enhanced skewing which also correlates with an enhanced CFR. Methods Plant material and growth conditions Arabidopsis thaliana Col- (wild-type, WT) and tno1 knockout mutant (SALK_112503) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center; the comple- mented tno1 mutant was generated previously in our laboratory [35]. Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in 33% bleach, .% (/) Triton -100 for 20 min, rinsed  times with sterile water and kept in the dark at    for at least  days before being subjected to the root skewing and waving assays or drug sensitivity assays described below. Arabidopsis hypocotyls were analyzed by plating sterilized seeds on .5X solid Murashige- Skoog (MS) medium [(Murashige-Skoog vitamin and salt mixture, Caisson, MSPA0910] with % sucrose, . mM MES (pH .), and .% (/) Phytoblend agar (Caisson, PTP01) and growing vertically at 22   in the dark. Root skewing and waving assays Skewing and waving assays were performed as described [, 37]. Arabidopsis plants were grown at 22   in long- day conditions (16  light) on .5X solid Murashige- Skoog (MS) medium (Murashige-Skoog vitamin and salt mixture, Caisson, MSPA0910) with % sucrose, . mM MES (pH .), and .% (/) Phytoblend agar (Caisson, PTP01). Seedlings were grown vertically for  days after Roy and Bassham BMC Plant Biology (2017) 17:73 Page  of\n\nwhich the root tip position was marked. The plates were then slanted backwards, 30o to the vertical, and grown for another  days. Images of the roots were acquired from the back of the plate using  Nikon SMZ1000 light microscope equipped with  Nikon S10 CoolPix camera. Analysis of root parameters was performed using Image  [38]. Root tip deviations to the right from the back of the plate were considered positive while deviations to the left were considered negative. Root morphometric analyses were performed as described [39]. Images of skewing/waving roots were analyzed with the ImageJ software [38] for measuring root tip abscissa (Lx) and length of the root () followed by calculation of horizontal growth indices (Lx/). Drug sensitivity assays Seedlings were grown vertically on plates containing either taxol (Paclitaxel, Sigma Cat #T7191) or propyza- mide (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat #45645) at the indicated concentrations for  days and skewing angles of roots were determined. Dark grown hypocotyl cell phenotypes were analyzed by placing -day-old hypocotyls on the surface of warm % low melting point agarose on  slide [40] and then imaging the imprints with  Zeiss Axioplan II light microscope. Cell file rotation analysis and propidium iodide staining The root surface of Arabidopsis seedlings was visualized using  Zeiss macro-zoom microscope at the Microscopy and NanoImaging facility, Iowa State University. Alter- natively, roots were stained with propidium iodide (ThermoFisher Scientific Cat #P3566). Seedlings were dipped in  working aqueous solution (10  /ml) of propidium iodide for  min and then washed twice by dipping in petri dishes filled with water for 30 . The roots were mounted in water and visualized using  Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP5; Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Con- focal and Multiphoton Facility. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 nm and 617 nm respectively. Laser power, scan frequency and line averaging were optimized and kept constant between samples and replicates. CFR angles of the roots were calculated as described [, 41] using ImageJ [38]. Immunostaining and analysis of microtubules Five-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on slanted medium were fixed and immunostained as described [42]. Mouse anti- - tubulin antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat #T6074), diluted :100, were used for immunolabel- ing of MTs followed by AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat #A11029) as  secondary antibody, diluted :500. Cells within the elongation zone were imaged by confocal microscopy with  Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP5; Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Confocal and Multiphoton Facility, using  40X (.25 NA) or 63X (. NA) Leica oil immersion objective. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 nm and 507 nm. Laser power, scan frequency and line averaging were optimized and kept constant between samples and replicates. Confocal images were analyzed with the freely available software package MicroFilament Analyzer (MFA) [43], and data was displayed as circular plots as generated by the software. MT angles generated by the software were classified into three classes,  to 10, 11 to 30 and 31 to 90 degrees using Microsoft Excel and used for subsequent analysis. Results Loss of TNO1 results in exaggerated root skewing Mutants lacking TNO1 have normal root elongation, but show  lag in root gravitropic bending upon gravisti- mulation [36]. Positive gravitropism is  key component driving root waving and skewing, and hence we hypothe- sized that TNO1 might play  role in these processes.",

Positive gravitropism is  key component driving root waving and skewing, and hence we hypothe- sized that TNO1 might play  role in these processes. To test this hypothesis, -day-old seedlings were grown vertically on the surface of hard agar medium (.% agar), the plates tipped over by 30o, and the seed- lings allowed to grow for an additional  days (Fig. 1a). The slant forces the root tip to press against the impene- trable medium due to positive gravitropism. As the root fails to penetrate the medium, cell expansion and circumnutation drive the root to the side and this alter- nates between rightward and leftward corrective devia- tions resulting in characteristic waving and skewing responses [, ]. tno1 mutant roots (KO) formed sinus- oidal wave-like growth patterns similar to WT (Col-) roots but had an exaggerated rightward skew compared to the WT roots, when seen from the back of the plate (Fig. 1b). tno1 mutants complemented with transgenic TNO1 under the control of its own promoter (COM) [35] had reduced skewing compared to the mutants and were similar to the WT roots (Fig. 1b). Root images were analyzed using ImageJ [38] and quantified for devi- ation of the root tips from their position at the time of slant initiation ( ) (Fig. 1c) [, 39]. tno1 mutants had  higher angle of deviation than the WT or complemented roots (Fig. 1d;  < .05). To confirm the difference in phenotype, another morphometric parameter, the horizontal growth index (HGI), was calculated for the skewing roots. HGI is the ratio of the root tip abscissa (Lx) and length of the root () (Fig. 1c) and is  sensitive and robust parameter to quantify lateral directions of growth, independent of root shape [39]. Root tips skewed to the right yield positive Lx values and negative values when roots skew left. positive Lx results in  positive HGI value, which then signifies  rightward Roy and Bassham BMC Plant Biology (2017) 17:73 Page  of\n\ndeviation while  negative value suggests leftward devi- ation [39]. tno1 roots had  significantly higher HGI than WT and complemented lines (Fig. 1e;  < .05), confirming that the tno1 mutants do indeed have an in- creased rightward deviation from the vertical. Skewing tno1 roots display enhanced root epidermal cell file rotation (CFR) The cellular basis for CFR is still not completely under- stood, but has been proposed to be  result of the circum- nutation of the root tip [20]. Circumnutation is dependent on an internal mechanism that results in an elliptical or cir- cular trajectory around an imaginary axis of growth [44]. The helical pattern of cell division at the root tip has been hypothesized to be the basis for epidermal CFR [, 10, 37]. The characteristic spiral cell division patterns of the outer circle of meristematic cells in the root apex causes  spiral- ing of the cell files, thus resulting in CFR formation [45], although this fails to explain why CFR initiates at the base of the elongation zone, away from the site of initial cell divisions. lag in anisotropic expansion rates between the epidermal and the inner cell layers can also cause  twisting of the cell files to compensate for stresses and strains that might otherwise cause tissue breakage []. CFR, usually preceding root bending and skewing [41], is visible at the base of the elongation zone of skewing roots. Rightward- skewing mutants usually display  dominant left-handed CFR [, 11]. We therefore hypothesized that the enhanced rightward skewing in the tno1 mutants would correlate with an increase in left-handed CFR. Microscopic analysis of mutant roots showed  marked left-handed epidermal CFR initiating in the root elongation zone (black arrow, Fig. 2a) while WT and complemented roots mainly have  vertical arrangement of cell files with  lack of distinct CFR in this region (Fig. 2a). Confocal im- aging of propidium iodide-stained roots revealed  distinct- ive left-handed CFR with  higher twist in the elongation zone of tno1 lines compared to the WT and complemented lines (Fig. 2b). Images were analyzed with ImageJ to quan- tify the left-handed twist of the cell files relative to the lon- gitudinal axis of the root. The tno1 CFRs were significantly higher ( < .01) than the WT and complemented root CFRs (Fig. 2c). This may explain the enhanced skew of the mutant roots, since the increased left-handed twist might cause larger deviations from the axis of growth. Skewing of tno1 roots is enhanced upon MT stabilization by taxol CFR can be caused directly by altered cortical MT organization, which influences anisotropic expansion as Fig. Loss of TNO1 protein function causes increased rightward root skewing.

Several mutants defective in MT stability, organization and dynamics have enhanced right- or left- ward skewing, with  dominant left or right-handed CFR respectively [18]. Many, but not all, also display  hand- edness of the cortical MT arrays that is opposite to the CFR handedness of the elongation zone of the roots. Some mutants defective in MT-interacting proteins show right-handed CFR, skew to the left, and display left-handed helical cortical MT arrays in the elongation zone [48, 49], while others have skewing defects but normal transverse MT array orientation in the root elongation zone. This suggests that the relationship between MT dynamics, orientation, and skewing is com- plex. We hypothesized that the enhanced skewing and CFR in tno1 mutants might also be due to changes in cortical MT array organization or dynamics. TNO1 is lo- calized to the TGN, and this hypothesis receives support from  recent study in which  TGN-localized protein was shown to activate  kinesin and be involved in root skewing and gravitropism, linking MTs and the TGN in the root skewing process [50]. The MT-stabilizing chemical taxol causes MT bundling and enhances rightward skewing in WT roots [, 51]. When grown vertically on increasing concentrations of taxol (Fig. 3a), tno1 roots showed significantly higher rightward skewing than the WT and complemented lines (Fig. 3a, ). The percentage increase in the skewing angle of the mutant roots from    to . taxol is signifi- cantly higher ( < .05) than in the WT and complemen- ted line roots (Fig. 3c). We hypothesized that this increase in skewing was due to an increase in the left-handed twist of the roots. Analysis of confocal images of propidium iodide stained roots in the presence of . taxol re- veals  larger left-handed CFR in the tno1 roots compared to WT and complemented lines (Fig. 3d, ). The pheno- type is reflective of the effect of taxol on the root growth rather than the effect of  slanted substratum, since the drug assay is conducted on vertically-oriented plates. These results suggest that MT stabilization exaggerates the root skewing and CFR phenotype of the tno1 mutants. Effect of MT destabilization by propyzamide (PPD) on root skewing in tno1 mutants The MT-destabilizing chemical propyzamide (PPD) also enhances rightward skewing in WT seedlings []. Since the effect of MT stabilization on root skewing in tno1 seedlings suggests  MT-based role for TNO1 in root movement, we tested the effect of PPD on root skewing in the tno1 mutant. WT and complemented roots showed  slight increase in rightward skew at    PPD and  marked increase at    PPD. Surprisingly, skewing of tno1 mutant roots was insensitive to PPD (Fig. 4a, ). The percentage increase in skewing observed for WT and complemented roots in the presence of PPD was signifi- cantly higher than in tno1 (Fig. 4c). The increase in Fig. Skewing tno1 roots display enhanced root epidermal cell file rotation.

While the TNO1 transgene in the com- plemented lines is expressed under its native promoter and its overall expression levels are similar to that of the endogenous protein, position effects within the genome may cause slight differences in expression pattern in different cell types. We hypothesized that the reduced skewing of tno1 roots in the presence of PPD would correlate with  reduced CFR when compared with CFRs of PPD treated-WT and complemented roots. Confocal micro- scopic analysis of the surface of roots growing on    PPD reveals  twisting of WT and complemented epider- mal cell files. The mutant root epidermal cell files also display considerable left-handed CFR, indistinguishable from WT and complemented lines (Fig. 4d, ). Hence, the resistance of tno1 roots to PPD-induced skewing is independent of PPD-induced CFR. To explain this observation, we hypothesized that the PPD treatment might have other effects on the mutant roots, including effects on root growth or morphology.

Surprisingly, mature regions of tno1 roots grown on    PPD had more severe defects in cell morphology when compared to PPD-treated WT and complemented lines, with the mutants displaying malformed cells (Fig. 5a). Whereas PPD-treated WT and complemented roots have typical long, narrow cells, tno1 mutant root cells are shorter and wider, indicating defects in anisotropic growth. This points to  possible defect in cell maturation or cell wall de- position that could potentially interfere with the ability of the tno1 roots to skew in the presence of PPD even as the CFR in the elongation zone continues to form nor- mally. It is possible that the defects in the mature zone of the PPD-treated tno1 roots could then affect how the growing root interacts with the substrate, which would in turn affect root skewing. To assess whether other organs and cell types in the mutant might also be sensitive to MT disruption by PPD, we analyzed agarose imprints of control and PPD- treated dark-grown hypocotyls. The base of the hypo- cotyls in the WT and complemented lines had cells with increased width when compared to their untreated counterparts. tno1 hypocotyls were hypersensitive to PPD, with much more severe defects in cell morphology when compared to the untreated tno1 seedlings and to Fig. Effect of MT destabilization by propyzamide (PPD) on root skewing in tno1 mutants.

The PPD-treated tno1 seedlings also lacked the spiraliza- tion of the cells observed in the treated WT and comple- mented lines. As observed in the skewing assay, the complemented lines were slightly more sensitive to PPD than WT, which again may be due to position effects. Cell elongation is initiated at the base of dark grown hypocotyls [52], and the loss of TNO1 may lead to an increased susceptibility of this cell expansion process to MT destabilization by PPD. Treatment with low concen- trations of PPD (such as   ) has been reported to cause  decrease in the dynamic instability of cortical MTs, leading to more static MTs that spend more time in the paused state compared to untreated cells [53]. Our results suggest that the disruption of MT dynamics by PPD has  more adverse effect on tno1 roots than WT. This could be manifest as defects in MT-array organization, anisotropic expansion, or both, resulting in the observed disruption in cell morphology in tno1. The orientation of MT arrays in the elongating cells of skewing tno1 roots is not affected MT arrays in elongation zones of roots are usually ar- ranged in  transverse orientation to facilitate aniso- tropic expansion. Skewing roots of some mutants with marked CFRs have distinct oblique arrays of MTs, with the handedness of  MT array opposite to that of CFR [18]. Strong correlations have also been observed be- tween angle of skewing and pitch of the MT arrays [11]. Many mutants that are defective in MT-associated processes have  change in the pitch of MT arrays asso- ciated with  corresponding change in CFR. However, some mutants with enhanced CFR show no obliqueness of the MT array, but rather have transverse arrange- ments similar to the central elongation zone cells of the WT roots. For example, the sku6 mutant maintains  transverse alignment of MT arrays despite its left- handed CFR [, 54] while the mor1  mutant, impaired in MT polymerization, also displays  left-handed CFR but no bias in MT array orientation [55]. These mutant phenotypes suggest that additional factors can also be responsible for  change in CFR, apart from the MT array orientation. We hypothesized that the dominant left-handed CFR in the tno1 roots would correspond to  right-handed MT array in the epidermal cells of the elongation zone compared to WT roots. Four-day-old chemically fixed WT and tno1 roots, grown on  slanted impenetrable medium, were immunostained with tubulin antibodies [42] to detect MTs and imaged by confocal microscopy. The MT arrays of epidermal cells in the mutant roots did not show any distinct handedness or change in pitch compared to WT epidermal MT arrays (Fig. 6a). Quanti- tative analyses on collected images were performed util- izing the MATLAB software package MicroFilament Analyzer [43] to allow comparison of MT orientation in multiple images from different biological replicates. The representative circular output graphs from the analyses suggest  mainly transverse orientation of the MTs in the elongation zone of both WT and tno1 roots (blue Fig. Effect of    propyzamide (PPD) on cell morphology of the mature region of the root and the base of the hypocotyl.

To assess whether  difference in the percentage of oblique MTs between the WT and mutant might explain the higher CFR in the mutants, MT angles of root cells from WT and tno1 roots were classified into three classes,  to 10, 11 to 30 and 31 to 90 degrees (Fig. 6c). No significant difference was found in the percentage of MTs in each class between the WT and mutant. Thus we conclude that tno1 mutants have normal transverse MT arrays in the skewing roots, suggesting that an alternative mech- anism must be responsible for the change in CFR. Discussion TNO1 plays important roles in post-Golgi trafficking, gravitropism and auxin transport-dependent processes. Here we demonstrate that TNO1 is required for root skewing and CFR formation. Skewing of tno1 mutant roots increased to  greater extent upon MT stabilization by taxol when compared to WT roots but was resistant to MT destabilization by PPD. This led us to postulate  role for TNO1 in MT-dependent processes, although MT destabilizing agents have also been reported to in- duce left-handed CFR without affecting MT arrays [53]. In roots, MT arrays transition from  disordered state in the meristematic zone to  transverse orientation in the elongation zone, and this organization is important for facilitating rapid anisotropic growth [42]. Defects in tubulin structure/activity and in MT-associated proteins can result in oblique MT arrays in the central elongation zone of roots. Oblique MT orientation in elongating cells causes cells to expand at an angle to the vertical, leading to CFR and root skewing [, 20, 56, 57]. Skewing roots of tno1 do not show an oblique MT orientation in the elongation zone but rather  transverse one. This suggests that the root movement phenotype in tno1 mutants arises independent of the organization of MT arrays in the root elongation zone, although dependent on MT dynamics. It is possible that, despite its normal orientation, the cortical MT array in tno1 roots might be compromised in restructuring or function as the root navigates  complex trajectory during skewing. The loss of TNO1 could potentially also affect the function of  MT-associated protein such as  kinesin; as an example,  TGN-localized kinesin-binding separase has recently been reported to affect root skewing [50]. Certain root skewing mutants have transverse MT arrays or  lack of directional bias in the MT arrays in the root elongation zone but have  distinct CFR [54, 58, 59].

This suggests that the MT array is not the only factor in- volved in generating CFR. Owing to anomalies such as these, Wasteneys (2004) proposed that CFR could arise due to torsional handedness inherent to roots, and the correlation between CFR and MT array orientations could result from signaling between the MT array and cell wall machinery. Thus, CFR could arise from the effect of MT arrays on anisotropic expansion in the elongation zone or, alternatively, from the effect of cellulose microfibrils on MT array alignment at the plasma membrane [46, 47]. Mutants that affect CFR formation but not MT array orientation in the elongation zone support this model, in- cluding mutants defective in regulation of anisotropic cell expansion [20, 54]. Based on this model, and consistent with the cell morphology phenotypes observed in the presence of PPD, TNO1 might be important for the aniso- tropic cell expansion process or in cell wall trafficking dynamics. lag in the expansion rates of internal cell types com- pared to the epidermal cells may cause roots to skew to prevent mechanical shearing [, 57]. The mature root cells and hypocotyls of tno1 seedlings treated with PPD showed marked disruption of cell morphology, suggesting  role for TNO1 in the cell maturation or expansion process. This model would also explain why tno1 roots skew des- pite the transverse MT arrays in the epidermal cells of the root elongation zone. Vertically-grown tno1 seedlings have similar root lengths to WT seedlings, suggesting normal cell expansion during vertical growth. Thus TNO1 might be required specifically for cell expansion during deviation of roots from their growth trajectory. During cell expansion and cellulose deposition, the cellulose synthase complex traffics via the TGN [60, 61]. The observed defects in cell morphology and expansion could be due to the role of TNO1 in proper localization of the TGN-localized -SNARE SYP61 [31, 32]. Prote- omic analysis of SYP61-containing vesicles [34] revealed the presence of cellulose synthase complex subunits, suggesting  role in trafficking of cellulose synthase subunits, which then drives cellulose deposition. MT array dynamics modulate the deposition of cellulose mi- crofibrils in expanding cells since cellulose synthase runs parallel to the MT array, with CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTIVE1 acting as  link between the cellulose synthase machinery and cortical MTs [62 65]. MTs also regulate exocytosis of vesicles containing cellulose syn- thase complex subunits or complex-associated proteins such as KOR1 and CSI1 [66 68]. Disrupting MT arrays therefore affects cellulose synthesis, deposition and orientation, while conversely, inhibiting cellulose syn- thase activity causes defects in MT arrays [69, 70], which can potentially affect directional growth patterns [18]. Inhibitors of cellulose synthase trafficking such as CES- TRIN cause MT instability and reduced cellulose content, and increase SYP61 and cellulose synthase co-localization [68]. Since CESTRIN does not affect the bulk secretory and endocytic routes, the SYP61-decorated domain of the TGN and its associated proteins such as TNO1 seem to be cru- cial for cellulose deposition and, indirectly, MT stability. However, mutations in cellulose synthase components (rsw1 , any1) or treatment with cellulose synthase inhibi- tors does not induce CFR [58, 71, 72]. Moreover, Sugimoto (2003) also reports that  cellulose synthase mutant can undergo CFR even when the MTs are compromised [58]. Trafficking of other proteins required for cell expansion and root movement might also be disrupted in tno1 mu- tants. For example, SKU5 is required for enzymatic reac- tions at the cell wall, and mutants lacking this protein show enhanced root skewing possibly due to altered cell wall composition during cell expansion [20]. Our observations suggest that CFR formation involves complex interactions and is not simply dependent on MT array and cellulose de- position patterns. Current models of the mechanisms of helical growth have been challenged by studies on tortifo- lia2 mutants, in which individual freely growing trichomes twist. These mutants therefore uncouple cell division pat- terns and tissue strain from twisting and suggest that indi- vidual twisting of cells can translate to higher-order organ twisting [73]. Understanding the exact role of TNO1 at the TGN and the mechanism by which it modulates CFR and skewing will thus be  challenge. Our results suggest that TNO1 and the TGN play  key role in CFR and root movement, adding another component to the network controlling root movement. Further experiments are necessary to test the exact role of TNO1 and its interacting partners in regulating root skewing and CFR formation. Future studies investigating TNO1  role in cellulose synthase trafficking, MT stabil- ity and cell expansion dynamics in skewing roots will increase our understanding of the function of TNO1. Since TNO1 affects auxin transport [36], our study now points to the possibility of an impact of TNO1 on auxin transport, MT dynamics and cell wall trafficking at the TGN. Discovering TNO1  precise role will help in eluci- dation of the function of the TGN SNARE machinery in plant growth and morphogenesis. Conclusions In conclusion, we have discovered  role for  TGN- localized protein in root skewing on the surface of impene- trable media. This adds to the growing list of endogenous factors that aid root movement. Our data, alongside prior investigations, also suggest  possible link between TNO1, auxin-dependent and MT-associated processes. better understanding of these mechanisms can lead to informa- tion that can be used to manipulate root growth and Roy and Bassham BMC Plant Biology (2017) 17:73 Page 10 of\n\ndevelopment patterns in various soil conditions and improve overall root architecture.

Indeed, two different oligomeric states of the bacterial mechanosensitive channel MscL have been resolved by -ray crystallography: The . tuberculosis channel (MtMscL) is  pentamer, while the . aureus protein (SaMscL) forms  tetramer. Because several studies suggest that, like MtMscL, the . coli MscL (EcoMscL) is  pentamer, we re-investigated the oligomeric state of SaMscL. To determine the structural organization of MscL in the cell membrane we developed  disulfide-trapping approach. Surprisingly, we found that virtually all SaMscL channels in vivo are pentameric, indicating this as the physiologically relevant and functional oligomeric state. Complementing our in vivo results, we purified SaMscL and assessed its oligomeric state using three independent approaches (sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, crosslinking, and light scattering) and established that SaMscL is  pentamer when solubilized in Triton -100 and C8E5 detergents. However, performing similar experiments on SaMscL solubilized in LDAO, the detergent used in the crystallographic study, confirmed the tetrameric oligomerization resolved by -ray crystallography. We further demonstrate that this stoichiometric shift is reversible by conventional detergent exchange experiments. Our results firmly establish the pentameric organization of SaMscL in vivo. Furthermore they demonstrate that detergents can alter the subunit stoichiometry of membrane protein complexes in vitro; thus, in vivo assays are necessary to firmly establish  membrane protein  true functionally relevant oligomeric state.

It is perhaps the best characterized mechan- osensor [], thus serving as  paradigm of how  membrane protein can detect and respond to mechanical forces []. Ironically, something as simple as the stoichiometry of the MscL complex has plagued the field with debate since its inception. The original model for the . coli MscL (EcoMscL) stoichiom- etry was  homo-hexameric organization, which was suggested by crosslinking and the study of tandem subunits []. This model then appeared to be supported by low-resolution two-dimensional crystallization of EcoMscL []. But the subsequent elucidation of the . tuberculosis channel (MtMscL) by -ray crystallography [] then suggested  pentameric organization, at least for this orthologue. This result led to  re-evaluation of EcoMscL stoichiometry [,], which supported  pentameric organization and brought into question whether the two-dimensional crystal- lization data could be fit by -fold as well as -fold symmetry. Thus, the field transiently seemed to have settled that MscL was most likely  pentamer. However, the recent crystallographic structure of the . aureus homolog (SaMscL) reveals  tetramer variant []. This latter finding has again raised questions regarding the true oligomeric state of MscL and evokes the possibilities either that MscL from different species assemble into complexes with different stoichiometries or that the channel exists as multiple functional oligomeric complexes in the cell membrane. Therefore, we set out to identify the MscL oligomeric state in the cell membrane and to understand how the SaMscL channel, which shares approximately 40% sequence identity with EcoMscL and MtMscL [], could exist in the non-pentameric subunit organi- zation resolved by -ray crystallography. We found not only that PLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org  December 2010 | Volume  | Issue 12 | e1000555\n\nthe true in vivo oligomeric state of SaMscL is  pentamer but also that at least one detergent, LDAO, artificially but reversibly reorganizes this structure into  tetrameric stoichiometry. Results With multiple oligomeric states identified in vitro, we devised  disulfide-trapping strategy to identify the oligomeric state of MscL in bacterial membranes. Using this approach, we were able to directly measure the subunit stoichiometry of SaMscL in vivo by generating  series of double-cysteine mutants in regions predicted to be in close proximity from both existing crystal structures (Figure 1A). These modifications allow crosslinking in the cell membrane via disulfide bonds as previously described [,10]. Briefly, the cells were osmotically shocked in the presence of the oxidizing agent copper-phenanthroline, centrifuged, and then immediately resuspended in SDS loading buffer to avoid unnecessary manipulation of the proteins. As we previously observed [], osmotic shock increased disulfide bridging, presum- ably because reductants including glutathione and thioredoxin are released from the cell [11], thus decreasing the reducing potential of the cytosol. The protein content of the lysed cells was evaluated using SDS-PAGE and molecular weight standards. For the L10C/ L89C or L10C/M91C SaMscL channels, we were able to observe efficient in vivo disulfide trapping (Figure 1B). For the L10C/ Author Summary The ability to detect mechanical forces is at the basis of not only the senses of touch hearing and balance but also cardiovascular and osmotic regulation. One of the primary ways that organisms detect forces is through mechan- osensitive channels, and mechanosensation is so vital that essentially all organisms have at least one such sensor. Indeed, the best-studied mechanosensitive channel is from bacteria, and because relatively little is known of mechan- osensors from higher organisms, these channels are  model for how  protein can sense and respond to mechanical forces. Although the bacterial mechanosensi- tive channel MscL has been well studied, the simple issue of how many subunits it has is hotly debated. There are even two published crystal structures showing either tetrameric or pentameric complexes. Here we show that the channel is actually pentameric in vivo and that the detergent used to solubilize the protein can rearrange the complexes from pentamers to tetramers. The finding that detergents can have such  profound effect on structure may have broad implications for the study of other membrane proteins. Figure . . aureus MscL is  pentamer in the cell membrane. () Two orientations of the SaMscL and MtMscL crystal structures are shown with the molecules viewed from the periplasmic side (top) and from the lipid bilayer (bottom). The locations of the residues used to perform the in vivo disulfide crosslinking experiments are highlighted on the structures in surface representation: blue represents L10 (SaMscL) and A10 (MtMscL), orange represents T89 (SaMscL) and T96 (MtMscL), and red represents M91 (SaMscL) and R98 (MtMscL).

However, for the L10C/M91C protein, one primary band was observed that reflects  pentameric complex. These data demonstrate that the pentamer is by far the major species within the cell membrane and thus appears to be the true structural and functional unit in vivo. With SaMscL pentamers being the predominant oligomeric state in the cell membrane, we wanted to understand why SaMscL crystallized as  tetramer. We began by confirming the previously observed pentameric and tetrameric states of MscL by performing crosslinking experiments of purified EcoMscL and SaMscL, visualizing their oligomeric state by Western blot analysis (Figure ). Five crosslinked EcoMscL products were observed, consistent with previous reports showing that EcoMscL is  pentamer [,]. In contrast with previous findings [], SaMscL also presented five crosslinked products, suggesting that SaMscL also exists in  pentameric oligomeric state. No difference was observed between proteins expressed by  high-expressing plasmid (pET) and those encoded  moderate-expressing plasmid (pB10), demonstrating that expressions levels have no effect on MscL oligomerization. To substantiate these results, sedimentation equilibrium analytical ultracentrifugation (SE) was performed to directly measure the mass of the SaMscL channel. The results for SaMscL were fit to  single- species model and yielded  molar mass of 71. kDa, consistent with  pentameric subunit organization (SaMscL theoretical pentameric molar mass is 72. kDa) (Figure 3A, ). As  third independent method to directly measure the mass of the SaMscL channel, we performed size exclusion chromatography multi-angle light scatter- ing (SEC-MALS) experiments [12]. Analysis of nine independent SEC-MALS experiments resulted in an average calculated SaMscL mass of 72.860. kDa (Ave  SD,  = ), again consistent with  pentameric subunit organization of SaMscL (representative exper- iment shown in Figure 3C). The data presented in Figures  and  show three independent approaches that all confirm the pentameric oligomeric state of SaMscL, in agreement with our in vivo crosslinking results. These data are also consistent with the MtMscL crystal structure [,13] and biochemical studies of EcoMscL [] but inconsistent with the subunit organization in the SaMscL crystal structure []. The major difference in the protein handling between our experiments and those previously published for the SaMscL channel [] was the choice of solubilizing detergent. Our measurements were made in the presence of either Triton -100 (crosslinking) or pentaethylene glycol monooctyl ether (C8E5) detergent (SE and SEC-MALS), not Lauryldimethylamine-oxide (LDAO), the detergent used previously to crystallize SaMscL and evaluate its oligomeric state []. To determine if the solubilizing detergent could account for the discrepancies in the data, we tested whether LDAO may affect the oligomeric state of SaMscL. We performed SaMscL crosslinking experiments in the presence of LDAO and found essentially no crosslinked pentamer and  substantial increase in tetramers when compared to the experi- ments performed in Triton -100 (Figure 4A). To confirm that LDAO was altering the oligomeric state of the SaMscL channel rather than simply affecting our crosslinking efficiency, we directly measured the mass of the SaMscL protein in the presence of LDAO by SEC-MALS (representative experiment shown in Figure 4B). The results show that the average protein mass in the presence of LDAO is 60.062. kDa (Ave  SD,  = ),  mass that is dramatically reduced compared to the C8E5 experiments (72.860. kDa) and that is consistent with  tetrameric oligomeric state (theoretical SaMscL tetramer is 57. kDa). As  third independent approach to assess the oligomeric state of the protein, we performed sedimentation velocity experiments on the SaMscL protein in LDAO. Two different methods were used to calculate the molar mass of the protein from these data (see Methods for details). Both resulted in similar values: 62.361.",

These results again show  protein molar mass well below that of  pentamer, consistent with LDAO affecting the oligomeric state of the SaMscL channel. We also tested the reversibility of this oligomeric state reorganization by using SaMscL purified in LDAO and then exchanged the LDAO detergent for C8E5. This protocol resulted in the SaMscL mass increasing from 61.460. kDa (Ave  SD,  = ) to 72.062. kDa (Ave  SD,  = ) as measured by SEC- MALS (Figure ). The choice of initial detergent made no difference in the reversibility, as purifying SaMscL in C8E5 and then exchanging the detergent for LDAO showed  mass decrease from 72.260. kDa in C8E5 (Ave  SD,  = ) to 58.760. kDa in LDAO (Ave  SD,  = ). Hence, the oligomeric rearrange- ment is reversible and is completely dependent upon the detergent solubilizing the MscL protein. Discussion Essentially all previous structural studies on MscL, as with most membrane proteins, have been performed on channels that have been solubilized, under the assumption that detergents do not alter the subunit stoichiometry. Our data examining the effect of different detergents on the oligomeric state of SaMscL have far- reaching implications for membrane protein research, as we now clearly demonstrate that changes in oligomeric state can and do occur upon detergent solubilization, and these alterations are not easily detected by SEC (see Figures 3C and 4B). To circumvent these artifacts associated with solubilization, we have developed an in vivo cross-linking assay. Although the pentamer is by far the Figure . . coli and . aureus MscL are pentameric multimers by crosslinking. Western blot analysis of DSS-treated . coli-MscL (Eco) and . aureus-MscL (Sa) expressed with either the pET21a (pET) or pB10 vector show five distinct bands at both expression levels. Molecular weight markers are shown to the left of the blot and the approximate location of monomers (16) to pentamers (56) is shown between the blots. The right-hand blot shows  separate experiment where the majority of the EcoMscL and the SaMscL protein are in the pentameric and monomeric forms. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1000555.g002 . aureus MscL Is  Pentamer In Vivo PLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org  December 2010 | Volume  | Issue 12 | e1000555\n\nmajor product observed in Figure 1B, very small amounts of smaller oligomers can be resolved upon overloading of protein gels and long Western blot exposures. The small amount of tetramers and smaller complexes observed upon long exposure could be incompletely assembled protein or may simply be due to the lack of disulfide bridging, which is rarely observed to be this efficient (.. see [,10]). In addition, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that oligomerization is  dynamic and even reversible process in vivo. Regardless, it seems unlikely that oligomeric species smaller than pentamers have  physiological role given that there are tens of channels per cell [14], and the smaller species compose only  few percent of the total channels. Our data definitively show that the vast majority of the SaMscL channel adopts  pentameric structure in the cell membrane, consistent with the MtMscL crystal structure [], but incompatible with the SaMscL crystal structure [].

This result was surprising because several studies using various techniques have suggested TM1 undergoes  significant clockwise rotation (as viewed from the periplasmic side) upon channel gating. The approaches supporting this interpretation include: spin labeling combined with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) studies [15], accessibility of sulfhydryl reagents to cysteine mutants in TM1 upon gating [16,17], accessibility of heavy metals to engineered binding sites in the pore [18], suppression mutagenesis demonstrating interactions between TM1 and TM2 upon gating [19], and confirmation of multiple interaction sites between TM1 and TM2 upon gating by using an electrostatic repulsion approach as well as disulfide trapping [10]. Both the EPR studies as well as the heavy-metal binding in the pore strongly suggest that this rotation occurs quite early in the gating process, before ion permeation. By this model, V21 and G24 (V23 and G26 in EcoMscL) should rotate away Figure . The . aureus MscL stoichiometry change is reversible. () The oligomeric state of SaMscL in  mM LDAO was determined using SEC-MALS, which measured  protein mass of 61. kDa, consistent with  tetrameric channel (top chromatogram). () The SaMscL-LDAO sample was exchanged into C8E5, and the following day the oligomeric state of SaMscL-C8E5 sample was measured by SEC-MALS. Analysis of the SEC-MALS results for the SaMscL-C8E5 sample showed  protein mass of 74. kDa, consistent with the channel in  pentameric state. doi:10.1371/journal.pbio.1000555.g005 . aureus MscL Is  Pentamer In Vivo PLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org  December 2010 | Volume  | Issue 12 | e1000555\n\nfrom the pore constriction, allowing V22 and the positively charged K29 (I24 and K31 in EcoMscL) to line the open pore. The observation that this rearrangement has not occurred strongly suggests that the crystal SaMscL structure actually reflects  strained closed state due to improper oligomeriazation, rather than an expanded intermediate state. The observed stoichiometry changes in detergents also evoke questions regarding how membrane protein subunits assemble into physiological multimeric complexes. previous report on EcoMscL demonstrated that when the protein is translated in vitro in the absence of any lipid or detergent and is subsequently purified in the presence of Triton -100, the channel spontane- ously assembles into pentamers [20]. separate study demon- strated that even synthetically synthesized EcoMscL will oligomer- ize into functional channels when incorporated into lipid membranes [21]. These studies demonstrate that the EcoMscL channel has the ability to self-assemble into the functional oligomer in vitro. Similarly, it appears that C8E5 and Triton -100 allow SaMscL to properly fold and assemble into  pentameric structure, which correlates with the observed oligo- meric state in vivo. In contrast, LDAO reorganizes SaMscL into tetramers that do not appear to exist in significant quantities in vivo, suggesting that they are not physiologically relevant. The observed self-assembly properties of EcoMscL under many conditions, combined with the reversible nature of the detergent- induced oligomeric state changes for SaMscL, may explain why Liu et al. observed channel function for the LDAO solubilized SaMscL tetramers []; presumably, once the tetrameric LDAO- solubilized SaMscL is reconstituted into lipids, it rearranges back into functional pentameric structures. The crystal structure of the SaMscL was derived from  truncation mutant in which several amino acids at the -terminus had been removed []. One previous study suggested that at least some -terminus deletions of EcoMscL could lead to the formation of larger aggregates when translated in  cell-free system [22]. While we cannot rule out the possibility that the SaMscL deletion contributed to the stabilization of the tetramer in the crystal, our data do demonstrate that detergents alone can stabilize alternative oligomeric states of the full-length SaMscL in solution. Our observations make it tempting to speculate that larger, more hydrated head groups (.. the head groups of C8E5 and Triton -100) promote pentamer formation, while smaller head groups (.. LDAO) promote tetramer formation. However, with such  small number of detergents tested thus far, additional experiments will be required to identify what chemical properties of the detergents cause the oligomeric state change and what effect, if any, lipids may have on the stabilization of specific oligomeric states. In sum, our data demonstrate that the physiologically active SaMscL oligomer in vivo is  pentamer and that purification in detergents can cause  reorganization of the SaMscL channel  oligomeric state. Our findings also show that SEC alone is insufficient to evaluate the usefulness of  particular detergent for the study of membrane proteins; ideally, SEC-MALS and/or analytical ultracentrifugation should be correlated with in vivo experiments that can more confidently determine the functional and physiologically relevant oligomeric state of membrane proteins.

However, with such  small number of detergents tested thus far, additional experiments will be required to identify what chemical properties of the detergents cause the oligomeric state change and what effect, if any, lipids may have on the stabilization of specific oligomeric states. In sum, our data demonstrate that the physiologically active SaMscL oligomer in vivo is  pentamer and that purification in detergents can cause  reorganization of the SaMscL channel  oligomeric state. Our findings also show that SEC alone is insufficient to evaluate the usefulness of  particular detergent for the study of membrane proteins; ideally, SEC-MALS and/or analytical ultracentrifugation should be correlated with in vivo experiments that can more confidently determine the functional and physiologically relevant oligomeric state of membrane proteins. Materials and Methods Purification SaMscL (accession number: CAG43065) was expressed using the pET21a vector in PB116 . coli cells grown to ..600 . . and induced with  mM IPTG for    at 37uC. Cells were harvested and stored at 280uC until needed. Cells containing SaMscL were lysed in 50 mM NaPi pH ., 300 mM NaCl, . mg/ml DNAse,  mg/ml lysozyme, and 150 ml protease inhibitors (Sigma) using  French press at 16K PSI at 4uC. The cell lysate was incubated with 40 mM -Decyl---Maltopyranoside (DM) for   at 4uC and then centrifuged at 24,0006g for 30 min at 4uC to clarify the lysate. mM imidazol was added to the resulting supernatant and then bound to  ml of Ni-NTA slury pre-equilibrated with 50 mM NaPi pH ., 300 mM NaCl,  mM imidazol, and 40 mM DM for   at 4uC. Standard metal affinity chromatography was performed with 10 column volumes of wash buffer containing 50 mM NaPi pH ., 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazol,  mM DM, and SaMscL was eluted with 50 mM NaPi pH ., 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazol, and  mM DM. The purest protein fractions were combined and concentrated using  10,000 molecular weight cutoff filter (Amicon). Detergent exchange was accomplished by adding 40 mM Lauryldimethylamine-oxide (LDAO) or % (/) pen- taethylene glycol monooctyl ether (C8E5) to the concentrated SaMscL and allowing the protein-detergent complex to equilibrate overnight at room temperature. The following day the protein was subjected to size exclusion chromatography using  superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) in 20 mM NaPi pH ., 170 mM NaCl, and  mM LDAO or .% (/) C8E5. The eluting peak was collected and concentrated using  50,000 molecular weight cutoff filter (Amicon) and used for either sedimentation equilibrium experiments or size exclusion chromatography-multiangle light scattering experiments (SEC-MALS). Crosslinking SaMscL and EcoMscL were cloned into pB10 and pET21a vectors and transformed into PB104 or PB116 . coli and purified as previously described [10]. % Triton -100 or 44 mM LDAO was used for MscL extraction with  final concentration of .% and . mM, respectively, after purification. For crosslinking reactions  mg of protein was incubated with  mM DSS (Thermo Scientific) on ice for  min. The reaction was quenched with  final concentration of 100 mM Tris pH . for 15 min at room temperature as recommended by the manufacturer. Samples were brought up in non-reducing sample buffer, were loaded on  Criterion  20% gel, and were subjected to Western as previously described [10]. The primary antibody anti-Penta His (Qiagen) was used at :,000 and the secondary Goat anti-Mouse HRP (Bio- Rad) at :100,000. Blots were developed using HRP substrate (Millipore) and exposed to film. In Vivo Disulfide Trapping Overnight cultures were diluted :100 and grown   at 37uC in LB. LB with   NaCl was then added for  final concentration of . . Cultures were then induced with  mM IPTG for   when an OD 600 of . was reached. Cultures were either Mock shocked (. NaCl LB) or shocked (water with . mM copper phenanthroline) at  :20 dilution for 15 min at 37uC. Samples were spun down at ,000  for 20 min and immediately re- suspended in non-reducing sample buffer, adjusted for final OD, and run on  % 20% gel (Bio-Rad) for Western blot analysis [10]. The primary antibody anti-Penta His (Qiagen) was used at :,000 and the secondary Goat anti-Mouse HRP (Bio-Rad) at :40,000. Blots were developed using HRP substrate (Millipore) and exposed to film. SEC-MALS  Shimadzu Prominence HPLC system equipped with  Shodex KW-803 SEC column was connected in line with  miniDAWN- TREOS light scattering instrument (Wyatt Technologies) and Optilab rEX refractometer (Wyatt Technologies). The light . aureus MscL Is  Pentamer In Vivo PLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org  December 2010 | Volume  | Issue 12 | e1000555\n\nscattering and refractive index instruments were calibrated following the manufacturer  guidelines, and 40 ml of running buffer (20 mM NaPi pH ., 170 mM NaCl and  mM LDAO or .% (/) C8E5) was used to equilibrate the SEC column and establish stable baselines for the light scattering and refractive index instruments. 25 75 mg of purified protein was used for each SEC- MALS experiment, and data were collected using ASTRA  software (Wyatt Technologies) and processed following the manufacturer  guidelines. LDAO and C8E5 dn/dc values (.1490 and .1240, respectively) were measured using the Optilab rEX following the manufacturer  guidelines and the SaMscL extinction coefficient was calculated from the amino acid sequence. Analytical Ultracentrifugation Buffer density-matching experiments were performed in  Beckman Coulter XL- Analytical Ultracentrifuge to identify the appropriate solution density to match the density of the C8E5 detergent. Volumes of 180 mL of solutions containing 20 mM NaPi pH ., .% (/) C8E5, and various concentrations of NaCl were placed in the sample sector of  dual-sectored, charcoal-filled Epon centerpiece (Beckman-Coulter; all AUC experiments were carried out in such centerpieces) that was sandwiched between sapphire windows. Identical buffers without detergent were placed in the reference sector. The centrifugation cells were centrifuged at  temperature of 25uC and  rotor speed of 50,000 rpm; an An-50Ti rotor was used for all centrifugation experiments. The formation of any detergent concentration gradient was monitored using interference optics. C8E5 was found to be neutrally buoyant in 20 mM NaPi pH ., 170 mM NaCl, which was then used for all sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation experiments with .% C8E5 at 25uC. , , 40, and 80 mM SaMscL samples were prepared and loaded into the assembled ultracentrifuge cells; buffer with detergent was deposited in the reference sector. Long solution columns (180 mL) were also used in this experiment. Centrifugation was performed at 25uC at ,500, 14,000, and 17,500 rpm. The data were analyzed using SEDFIT to determine if the samples had come to equilibrium, and SEDPHAT [23] was used to fit the sedimentation equilibrium data to  single species model. Multispeed analysis with mass-conservation constraints was per- formed, allowing the time-invariant and radially invariant noise elements to be calculated and subtracted from the data [23]. 68.% confidence interval was calculated as previously described [24,25]. The error number reported is the average of the positive and negative deviations from best mass value. For the determination of the amount of detergent bound per gram of protein (dD), buffer without detergent was used in the reference sector, and two different concentrations (41 and 66 mM) of MscL were placed in the sample sector. The volume of each sample and reference was 390 ml. The rotor speed used was 50,000 rpm, and the temperature setting was 20uC. The data were analyzed in SEDFIT using the non-interacting discrete species model [26,27]. The flotation of the detergent micelles (the density of LDAO is less than that of water) was explicitly accounted for by giving that species  negative sedimentation coefficient. The amounts of absorbance units and interference fringes present for the main sedimenting species were derived from this analysis. Using the calculated extinction coefficient of the protein and the known refractive index increments of the detergent and the protein, dD was calculated as in le Maire et al. [28]. Subsequent sedimentation velocity experiments were performed with 20, 32, and 64 mM SaMscL samples in  mM LDAO at 50,000 rpm at 20uC. The volume centrifuged was 390 mL. In these cases, the reference buffer contained the same [LDAO] as the sample. The absorbance data (interference data were not collected) were initially analyzed using the () model in SEDFIT [26]. Although LDAO has  very low extinction coefficient at 280 nm, its floatation was detectable; the range of data near to the meniscus was therefore eliminated for this analysis. In these analyses, small quantities (% % of the total signal) of large species were detected. Using this information, all species, including the floating detergent, were modeled in the  species analysis  model in SEDPHAT [26]. This approach is referred to as the   and   method in the text, because both the sedimentation coefficient and the diffusion coefficient are refined to arrive at the buoyant molar mass (Mb). Mb was transformed to  (the molar mass of the protein) using the formula ~ Mb {w0r \u0002 \u0003 ,    where {Q0r    ~ {\u0002vPr    zdD {\u0002vDr    :    [29] The symbol  is the solution density, \u0002vP is the partial specific volume of the protein, and \u0002vD is the partial specific volume of the detergent. Any lipids bound to SaMscL were neglected in these calculations. Mb was also calculated using the relationship Mb~6pN0gRss,    where N0 is Avogadro  number,  is the solution viscosity, Rs is the Stokes radius of the protein/detergent complex, and  is the sedimentation coefficient. The Stokes radius of the protein was obtained by calibrating the SEC column described above with proteins of known Stokes radius. Rs for SaMscL in LDAO was . nm. Again, Mb was transformed to  using Eq. . Values for \u0002vP, , and  were estimated using the program SEDNTERP [30]. The value of \u0002vD was taken as .13 mL/ [31]. Confidence intervals of  and Mb were calculated as detailed above. confidence interval for the value of Stokes radius, which was derived from  linear regression, was: Rs+ta=2ss   1z    Ve{ \u0002Ve     SVV  , where  is the  statistic, ss is the estimate of  for the regression line, Ve is the elution volume of MscL from the SEC column, \u0002Ve is the average elution volume of the standards,  is the number of standards, and SVV is the sum of squared deviations of the individual standard compared to \u0002Ve. In cases of asymmetric error intervals, the  was taken as the average of the difference between the boundary value and the best-fitted value. Because multiple experiments, each having different errors, were performed, the value of  reported in the main text is the weighted mean mw  the weighted  (sw), calculated using the formulas: mw~   Mi:  s2     s2  , and sw~     s2  for the  experiments preformed ( =  in this case). . aureus MscL Is  Pentamer In Vivo PLoS Biology | www.plosbiology.org  December 2010 | Volume  | Issue 12 | e1000555\n\nAcknowledgments The authors thank Christina Eaton and Drs.

Here, we expand on this work to determine the biological factors rescued by the countermeasure treatment. We performed RNA-sequencing and tran- scriptomic analysis on 3D microvessel cell cultures exposed to simulated deep space radiation (. Gy of Galactic Cosmic Radiation) with and without the antagonists to three microRNAs: miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p (.., antagomirs). Signi cant reduction of in ammation and DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) activity and rescue of mitochondria functions are observed after antagomir treatment. Using data from astronaut participants in the NASA Twin Study, Inspiration4, and JAXA missions, we reveal the genes and pathways implicated in the action of these antagomirs are altered in humans. Our  nd- ings indicate  countermeasure strategy that can potentially be utilized by astronauts in space ight missions to mitigate space radiation damage. The perils of human space exploration span the gamut of exposure to space radiation, altered gravity  elds, and prolonged isolation in  hostile/closed environment1. The profound effects on human health may include bone and muscle atrophy, increased intracranial pressure, enhanced risk of developing cancer and cardiovascular disease, and impaired neurocognitive functions2. These physical and psychological stressors present  major concern for maintaining the overall health of space ight crews. The biological consequences of space ight also present  unique opportunity to analyze aspects of natural and disease pathologies that occur terrestrially3 . Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) critically impact cell non- autonomous regulation of post-transcriptional processes, can be used as biomarkers6,, and are associated with human diseases8 10. We have extensively characterized  circulating miRNA signature asso- ciated with the space environment using biomedical samples from astronauts, in vivo rodent models, in vitro cellular models, and 3D Received: 19 December 2022 Accepted: 17 May 2024 Check for updates  full list of af liations appears at the end of the paper. -mail: ;  Nature Communications| (2024) 15:4825  1234567890():,; 1234567890():,;\n\nhuman-derived cell cultures under simulated and real space exposure11 14. Transcriptome analyses demonstrated expression of candidate miRNAs were altered in liver, kidney, adrenal gland, thy- mus, mammary gland, skin, and skeletal muscle from space- own animal models11 and revealed  conserved miRNA signature between rodents and humans13. The altered miRNA signature discovered after exposure to space irradiation was predicted to affect the cardiovas- cular system and was widely associated with mitochondrial dysfunction13. Treatment of 3D microvessel cell cultures with miRNA inhibitors (referred to as antagomirs) targeting three of these miR- NAs, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, prevented microvessel collapse13 and rescued the inhibition of angiogenesis15 caused by space radiation exposure. Multi-omic analyses of biomedical pro les of astronauts along with several hundred space-related data points showed that major shifts in mitochondrial gene expression may be central to space ight- associated health risks12. Mitochondria are responsible for metabolic activity through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and mito- chondrial dysfunction decreases energy availability, alters cellular metabolism, and leads to cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and muscular and neurological disorders16. Here,  3D model for human microvessels is used to explore the cellular biology consequences of miRNA inhibition, particularly focusing on how the endothelial cell layer may be involved with cardiovascular damage. We  nd that antagomir treatment reduces DNA damage induced by space radiation, and is associated with improved stress responses at the molecular and morphological levels. Furthermore, we con rm the speci  targets of the miRNAs in astronaut samples from the NASA Twin Study17,  JAXA mission18, and the  rst civilian commercial space ight mission, Inspiration4 (I4)19. Our results suggest that these miRNAs may be targeted as counter- measures to alter cellular signaling pathways to mitigate space ight damage and reduce human health risks in human space ight missions. Results Combined antagomir inhibition is effective in counteracting space radiation damage We investigated the cellular alterations associated with the protective roles of three antagomirs targeting miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let7a- 5p in  3D human microvasculature model. Firstly, we examined the effect of individual miRNAs to mitigate structural damage caused by space radiation exposure from simulated Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR). The morphology of mature microvessels representing post-mitotic cells with characteristics of the endothelial barrier (tight junctions) was preserved by inhibiting any of the three key miRNAs (Fig. 1a, ). single dose of each individual antagomir 24  before GCR irradiation was suf cient to protect microvessels although the combination of the three was more effective. Furthermore, the inhibition by each miRNA was comparable to the unirradiated controls. similar result was found for the longer multistage develop- ment of microvessels undergoing angiogenesis. In this model, cells were exposed to GCR on culture day , when they were still indivi- dual and not connected; while the irradiation effects were seen on day , when the endothelial cells should have been formed into mature microvessels (Fig. 1b, ). Individual antagomirs applied on days  and  restore angiogenesis at levels comparable to controls, and combined antagomirs exert an improved protective role (Fig. 1b). In both models, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p are similarly effective at counteracting the effects of space radiation, but the antagomir combination inhibition of the three miRNAs provides  stronger and more robust response. Hereafter, we focus on the biological changes occurring when inhibiting all three miRNAs. Combined antagomir inhibition protects microvessels from DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by space radiation While the biological consequences of GCR exposure on mature and developing microvessels are clearly observed 24  and  days after irradiation, respectively, examination of earlier endpoints would enable us to understand the impactof antagomir treatment. Since DNA is the primary target damaged by radiation, early effects from miRNA inhibition on DNA damage and repair were investigated. As the repair of DNA DSB damage by space radiation is pivotal for cellular function, we assessed the cellular proteins involved in DNA DSB repair targeted by miRNA inhibition. Many of the DNA DSB repair genes are common targets of the miRNAs as shown by  network representation for the perturbation effects of miR-125b-5p, miR-16-5p, and let-7a-5p (Fig. 2a). These results suggest that miRNAs play an important role in activating the DNA DSB repair pathways induced by GCR irradiation. To determine the molecular mechanism through which the antagomirs protect mature and developing microvessels from the effects of GCR, we studied the accumulation of DNA DSBs and the activation of DNA repair pathways. Immunocytochemical staining for the tumor suppressor p53 binding protein  (53BP1) was quanti ed following antagomir treatment 90 min after GCR irradiation (Fig. 2b). The 53BP1 protein accumulates at the site DNA DSBs after irradiation, and the resulting repair foci can be measured as  critical platform for DNA DSB repair activity20. The peak DNA repair foci often occurs around 30 min after gamma irradiation and our previous publications showed that foci induced by charged particles decline over several hours in the human microvasculature model21. Our current analysis shows  signi cant increase in DNA DSB repair foci (Fig. 2b). In con- trast, the antagomir treatment signi cantly decreased the number of foci to levels similar to the unirradiated condition. This demonstrates that the antagomirs protect microvasculature cells from DNA DSBs caused by space radiation at much earlier times due to potentially providing  more ef cient DNA repair mechanism. The changes in expression of miRNAs after GCR exposure and its relationship to DNA repair mechanisms is not widely understood22. To determine if DNA DSBs are associated with  global response from those evolutionarily conserved miRNAs that we observed in vivo, we exposed C57BL/ female mice to . Gy of GCR and performed miRNA- sequencing on the plasma, liver, soleus muscle, and heart (Fig. 2c, ). From pathwayanalysis23 of DNA DSB and repair pathways, we observed  comprehensive increase in DNA DSB genesets across all four tissues from the measured changes in miRNA expression. The global increase associated with overall miRNA activity following GCR irradiation fur- ther supports the key roles of these miRNAs in the DNA DSB repair pathways. Space radiation reveals key regulation of the three miRNAs in speci  tissues To further establish miRNA changes after space radiation and the importance of miR-16, miR-125b, and let-7a with cardiovascular health risks, we performed weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on the miRNA-seq data from the mice exposed to . Gy of GCR (Fig. )24. WGCNA classically was designed for transcriptomic RNA-seq data, but recently has proven its utility in miRNA-seq data25,26. Hence, we utilized WGCNA to determine key miRNA networks that are impacted by space radiation and how they are affected in the heart, liver, soleus muscle, and plasma of mice. The WGCNA analysis revealed three distinct miRNA networks (..,  Modules  or  ME ) that are most strongly impacted by GCR radiation, depending on the tissue type (Supplementary Fig. and Fig. 3a ). Interestingly, for all three Mod- ules the heart tissue showed the most signi cant decrease comparing GCR irradiated mice to sham (Fig. 3a ). For Module  (Figs. 3a) and  (Fig. 3c), the liver shows  signi cant increase. When observing the key Article  Nature Communications| (2024) 15:4825\n\nmiRNAs involved in each module we see that let-7a-5p is present in Module  (Fig. 3d), miR-16-5p in Module  (Fig. 3e), and miR-15b-5p in Module  (Fig. 3f). The individual miRNAs within each Module were differential expressed due to GCR radiation (Supplementary Fig. ). Rescue of space radiation damage with inhibition of key miRNAs associated with cardiovascular space radiation damage Based on our intriguing results showing complete protection of the 3D human microvessel cell cultures post GCR irradiation by the inhibition of three miRNAs, we further investigated the key biological processes involved. We performed bulk RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on the mature microvessel and angiogenesis models after . Gy of GCR exposure and compared conditions with or without the combination of antagomirs (Fig. ). The experimental design for the antagomir treatment is depicted in Fig. 4a. The antagomir treatment and end- points after irradiation differ between the two models as described in Malkani et al.13 for the mature microvessel model and Wuu et al.15 for the angiogenesis model.

Article  Nature Communications| (2024) 15:4825\n\nGlobal transcriptomic analysis of RNA-seq results revealed key patterns associated to antagomir treatment after GCR irradiation. Overall, antagomir treated samples post-irradiation clustered closer to the sham unirradiated samples for both microvessel cell cultures (Fig. 4b). This indicates that the antagomir treatment had  substantial impact on restoring gene expression back to normal levels. Of note, we are utilizing -value statistics for our main analysis and acknowledge that this may result in the potential of more false positives, but we believe that the information generated by lowering the statistical sig- ni cance will produce more meaningful data and previous literature also provided further justi cation when necessary to utilize - values27,28. In addition, we have also provided the adj. -value analysis for full transparency of our results (Supplementary Fig. ). Although the global clustering of both models demonstrates  restoration closer to the basal levels, there are measurable differences between the two models with GCR irradiation alone and GCR with the antagomirs. This is apparent when observing the transcriptomic pat- terns for the signi cantly regulated genes (Fig. 4c). GCR irradiation caused  greater number of genes to be differentially regulated for the mature vessel compared to the angiogenesis model (Fig. 4d, ). Antagomir treatment during irradiation in mature (before) or in angiogenesis cells (after) caused signi cant dysregulation in both models (Fig. 4d, ). Substantially more genes were uniquely altered in the angiogenesis compared to the mature microvessel model (Fig. 4f), as may be expected since the endpoint is much longer than in the mature microvessel model and encompasses multiple stages of development. We also identi ed  set of orphan genes to be differentially regulated in GCR-stressed samples and reversed by antagomir treatment. Orphan genes code for proteins that are unique to  species29 31 and may provide  major source of evolutionary novelty conferring bene cial traits to  species. Evidence-based (EB) orphan genes were identi ed by Singh32 based on  comprehensive analysis of 27,000 RNA-Seq datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression project. To determine how human orphan genes respond to space radiation and antagomir treatment, differential expression of orphan genes was assessed in the RNA-seq data. In both models, tens of orphan genes were differentially Fig. | Quanti cation of DNA double strand break (DSB) repair foci with antagomir treatment and miRNA pathway analysis.

Since orphan genes often integrate themselves into metabolic and regulatory networks31,33,34, these could play  role in the dysregulation of DNA repair and metabolic pathways associated with response to space radiation and antagomir treatment observed here. To better identify dysregulated genes targeted by the antagomirs, we used miRNA target analysis by the mirDIP algorithm35 to assess transcripts downregulated by irradiation but restored after antagomir treatment. Twenty-one gene targets, including PDPR, APAF1, XPO6, NIBAN1, and SLC7A1, were predicted to be simultaneous targets of each miRNA (Fig. 5a). To validate the key genes, we performed PCR on  of the 21 genes from the same isolated RNA utilized for the RNA-seq (Fig. 5b). We see that all the genes are in agreement with the RNA-seq data except for MSH5, which we see an upregulation with . Gy and then the expression returns back to  Gy levels after antagomir treat- ment. We investigated how well the miRNAs bound to the 21 gene targets ( antagomir-rescued genes ), and the log2 fold change from the RNA-seq data after GCR exposure. We observed that the three miRNAs bound to the  -UTR and CDS regions of 15 (Fig. 5c) and 13 (Fig. 5d) out of the 21 antagomir-rescued genes, respectively, whereas let-7a-5p and miR-125b-5p bound only to two of the target genes (Fig. 5e). To survey the ef cacy of the three miRNAs to downregulate the 21 gene targets, we analyzed RNA-seq fold change values from different experimental conditions using cumulative plots36 see Methods). Fig- ure 5f shows that the 21 antagomir-rescued genes with -8mer  -UTR sites had  signi cant propensity to be downregulated compared to those without  -UTR sites ( = .99e 07, .65e 32 and .31e 09 for 8mer, 7mer-m8 and 7mer-A1, respectively, using the Kolmogorov Smirnov test). These results indicate that miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let7a-5p play  key role in the downregulation of the 21 antagomir-rescued genes. Figure 5g,  shows that the down- regulation of these genes is drastically reduced under antagomir treatment, indicating that by inhibiting these  miRNAs, expression of these genes reverts towards the control ( Gy) levels. Pathway analysis of the antagomir-restored transcripts targeted by one or more of the three miRNA shows an enrichment pattern for expression of genes associated with apoptosis and TP53-mediated cell death, cell cycle and mitotic phase transitions, innate immune response, and mitochondrial processes related with amino acids (Supplementary Fig. ). Thus, alteration of these pathways may account for the observed preservation of the 3D microvessels by antagomir treatment with GCR exposure. To con rm that these 21 genes are actual targets for the three miRNAs we dissected the pathways involved with the mirDIP algo- rithm analysis and also provided experimental evidence from cur- rent databases and literature. While mirDIP draws from  comprehensive pool of 24 databases to evaluate miRNA targets35, Fig. | MiRNA based weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) on different organs from GCR irradiated mice.

Article  Nature Communications| (2024) 15:4825\n\nour focus was on the analysis of the six most reputable databases among them (Fig. 5i). Additionally, we corroborated the experi- mental validation of these gene targets by cross-referencing data from three databases (.. miRTarBase37, TarBase38, and starBase39) alongside pertinent literature references (Fig. 5i and Supplementary Table ). Our results indicate robust experimental validation of gene targets for the three miRNAs as follows: 10 out of 10 for miR-16-5p, 13 out of 14 for let-7a-5p, and  out of 15 for miR-125b-5p. It  worth noting that while the validation rate for miR-125b-5p stands at 60% based on these databases, certain contextual conditions may in uence the validation of gene targets for miRNAs. Nevertheless, our additional experimental evidence (Fig. 5b ) enhances the con dence in our  ndings. Finally, it is crucial to assess the conservation of these three miRNAs between humans and mice. It is well-established that miRNAs exhibit high levels of conservation across species, particularly between mice and humans40. Our analysis demonstrates 100% conservation of all three mature miRNAs (.. miR-16-5p, miR-125p-5p, and let-7a-5p) and their precursor forms have conservation rates greater than 95% between mouse and human genomes (Fig. 5j). Given the robust con- servation observed, comparisons between results obtained in mouse and human contexts can be easily facilitated.

The NASA Twin Study has been described in several papers which compared two identical twins with one Twin on the ISS for 340 days and the other twin on Earth12,17. The JAXA study conducted RNA-seq on plasma cell-free RNAs from six astronauts who were on the International Space Station (ISS) for 120 days, sampled from pre- ight, during  ight, and post- ight time points. The I4 mission performed single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on the blood and also RNA-seq skin biopsies which involved  astronauts (two males and two females) that orbited at low Earth orbit (LEO) at 590 km above the atmosphere (Fig. 6f). The I4 mission occurred at  much higher altitude than the ISS, thus the I4 astronauts experienced  higher accumulated dose of radiation compared to being on the ISS. It is important to note that the estimated accumulated doses of space radiation that the astronauts were exposed to for these missions were lower than . Gy (which is the estimated dose for  trip to Mars and back), but despite this we still observed key changes as we will describe below. The following are the accumulated doses that were measured for each mission: NASA Twin Study astronaut received 146.34 mSv or 14.634 cGy17, I4 astronauts received .72 mSv or .472 cGy19, and for the JAXA astronauts we estimated that they had received an accumu- lated dose of 51.60 mSv or .16 cGy (the dosimetry was not reported for this mission and this is an estimate based on the average dose received per month from other missions)18. Using RNA-seq data from the NASA Twin Study, we analyzed the expression of the 21 antagomir-rescued genes over four different cir- culating cell populations with the Twin onboard the ISS for 340 days: CD4  cells (Fig. 6a), CD8  cells (Fig. 6b), CD19  cells (Fig. 6c), and  lymphocyte depleted cell population which will represent the mono- cytes (Fig. 6d). There are individual gene variations observed from pre ight to the last time point after return (.. + 200 days), but the overall gene signature changes will indicate how these genes will be impacted by the three miRNAs. The global changes for these 21 genes over time is best observed with cumulative plots for the different cell types for the Twin in space over time (Supplementary Fig. 7a and Fig. 7a). It was observed that the only cell type to show signi cant Fig. | 21 key gene targets for the three miRNAs restored back to control levels after antagomir treatment.

We show that for  ight vs pre- ight and  +  vs pre- ight (.. immediately after return to Earth) there was signi cant downregulation for these key genes and then at 34 days and beyond, the genes have returned back to the control pre- ight expression. To establish the direct relationship between the 21 gene targets and the three miRNAs, we utilized the NASA Twin Study which had both miRNA- and mRNA-seq data associated with the mission and cell types. Similar to the cumulative plots, we observed the correlation between the three miRNAs (.. miR-16, let-7a, and miR-125b) with the 21 gene targets in the four different cell types (.. CD4, CD8, CD19, and Article  Nature Communications| (2024) 15:4825\n\nmonocytes) (Supplementary Fig. 7b). We correlated with the over- lapping time points per each sample type and observed for the majority of the miRNAs and genes targets an inverse relationship. Speci cally, for monocytes for the speci  gene targets the miRNAs had an inverse correlation (Fig. 7b). Since the miRNAs will traditionally silence the speci  gene target, this result is what we would expect and provides further validation in astronauts that these miRNAs in circu- lation will be ideal targets to reduce health risks as our in vitro results show. We noticed that most of the 21 antagomir-rescued genes in the JAXA data were downregulated during the  ight, indicating that increased activity of the let-7a-5p, mir-125b-5p, and mir-16-5p might cause the suppression of these target genes in astronauts (Fig. 6e). Most of the genes show up-regulation post- ight as compared to pre-  ight and during  ight (Fig. 6e). This is consistent with the i4 data, in which antagomir-rescued gene activity is signi cantly increased post-  ight compared to the pre- ight in most of the cell types sampled from the astronauts (Fig. 6c). The ratio of up-regulation in these selected 21 antagomir-rescued genes is more signi cant than the average up- regulation ratio of all genes (Fig. 6c, ), suggesting that this subset is more susceptible to expression change due to the space environment. Cell-dependent differences are detectable for speci  genes during space ight for the I4 astronauts data (Fig. 6e  and Supple- mentary Fig. ). Two genes, ARL6IP6 (ADP Ribosylation Factor Like GTPase  Interacting Protein ) and TSEN15 (TRNA Splicing Endonu- clease Subunit 15), are signi cantly up-regulated post- ight compared to pre- ight in eight of the ten cell types, with CD16+ cells and den- dritic cells (DCs) not signi cantly different for ARL6IP6 and CD14+ cells, and DCs not signi cantly different for TSEN15. ARL6IP6 is involved in ischemic strokes in patients41, which could have implica- tions related to microvessel damage in space. In murine stem cells, ARL6IP6 exhibits properties of regulating nuclear envelope structure, interacting with proteins involved in nuclear envelope resealing and repair42. TSEN15 is involved in tRNA splicing and intron removal fun- damental processes for cell growth and division43.

Although this occurs at an early stage of life (.. infants), one could speculate that TSEN15 may play important roles in cell proliferation in adults. Interestingly, TSEN15 has also been associated with autoin ammatory neurodegenerative diseases45. ARL6IP6 (ADP ribosylation factor like GTPase  interacting protein ) is predicted to be targeted by miR-125b-5p and let-7a-5p and TSEN15 is predicted to be targeted by miR-16-5p and let-7a- (Fig. ). Skin biopsies from the i4 astronauts were also used for RNA-seq comparing post- ight to pre- ight (Fig. 6s) with four different skin regions in the analysis: Outer Epidermis (OE), Inner Epidermis (IE), Outer Dermis (OD), and Vasculature (VA). The VA compartment is closely related to the 3D microvessel cell models which seems to produce the strongest regulation of the 21 key genes. ARL6IP6 is upregulated in the VA for post- ight compared to pre- ight similar to what is observed in the blood (Fig. 6i ), while TSEN15 is down- regulated. Interestingly, 57%, 52%, and 52% of the 21 genes were downregulated for the OE, IE, and VA regions, while for the OD region only 38% were downregulated. Overall, for all the astronaut data, the measured changes of these genes from ex vivo cellular samples may suggest that an interventional treatment with the three antagomirs might lead to improved astronaut health. Major cellular pathways altered by radiation exposure and res- cued by antagomir treatment To determine the key pathways that are altered by radiation with or without antagomir treatment, we performed pathway analysis on the bulk RNA-seq data via Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Using the Hallmark database46, general pathway enrichments were more pro- nounced in the mature microvessels compared to the angiogenesis model (Fig. 8a, ). Radiation exposure in both these models triggered positive enrichment of pathways typically observed from this treat- ment such as TP53, Interleukin- (IL-), and TNF-alpha signaling. For both the mature microvessel and angiogenesis cellular models, there was  signi cantly decreased enrichment associated with the mitotic spindle due to radiation exposure that was reversed by the antagomir treatment. This is consistent with the fact that cellular death following radiation exposure may occur through mitotic catastrophe due to failure of mitotic spindle checkpoints47. An increase in in ammatory-related genes and pathways after irradiation is  common occurrence driving the late effects of radiation injury48,49. Radiation exposure with antagomir treatment caused  signi cant reversal in enrichment for several of these pathways. Strikingly, in both mature and angiogenesis microvessels, pathways for Fig. | Pathway analysis on the mature and angiogenesis 3D microvessel cell culture models revealing key functions being mitigated by the antagomirs after exposure to GCR irradiation.

Pathways for hypoxia, DNA repair, and oxidative phos- phorylation are also activated with the GCR treatment while the antagomir treatment inhibits these pathways. The antagomirs also restored the suppression associated with cell cycle observed with space radiation for the angiogenesis model (Fig. 7b). As  result, the antagomirs appear to be regulating key pathways in the radiation response that may be essential in assisting repair of the damage caused by space radiation in the mature microvasculature. To further explore the consequences of antagomir treatment to radiation exposure, Reactome genesets consisting of 26 super path- ways were examined (Fig. 8c, ). Positively or negatively enriched genesets in the same direction by irradiation with or without antag- omirs were excluded. The remaining genesets have opposing enrich- ments or are enriched by only one treatment. These pathways may represent critical targets that provide bene cial effects from antag- omir treatment. Genes involved in DNA repair by Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) are enriched in mature microvessels after radiation exposure (Fig. 8c). However, adding antagomirs suppresses these changes as well as changes in genes linked to DNA damage bypass via translation synth- esis. This was accompanied by  decrease in pathways involved in cellular stress [.. genesets for heme oxygenase , hypoxia, detox-  cation of ROS, EIF2AK4 (GCN2) amino acid de ciencies] as well as  decrease in cell cycle control including telomere maintenance. Nota- bly, there was an overall increase in extracellular matrix (ECM) orga- nization with the irradiation and antagomirs that was not statistically signi cant with radiation alone. Earlier during the angiogenesis phase of the microvessels, irradiation overwhelmingly decreased cell cycle genesets while the addition of the antagomirs abolished this statisti- cally signi cant manifestation (Fig. 8d). DNA replication as well as DNA DSB repair by homologous recombination was also returned to non- signi cant control levels by antagomir treatment. DNA damage, in ammation, stress and mitochondrial dysfunc- tion are normally associated with the induction of cellular senescence48. Therefore, we used publicly available databases com- piling markers of cellular senescence50,51 to investigate whether GCR caused senescence and the antagomirs protected the 3D human microvasculature model from it. Curiously, most senescence pathways were suppressed by GCR, except for oncogene-induced senescence (Supplementary Fig. ). This is consistent with upregulation of TP53 target genes, although it dissociates oncogene induction from other causes of senescence induction. The antagomirs did not revert these phenotypes, except in the angiogenesis model, where they promoted cellular senescence in GCR-exposed cells. Antagomir treatment after space radiation modulates critical cellular pathways To speci cally observe how key immune and in ammatory pathways are regulated with and without the antagomir treatment in the space environment, we analyzed  custom curation of genesets for innate and adaptive immune pathways (Fig. ). There was an overall increased activity with GCR radiation exposure for the mature microvessel cul- ture. However, when the antagomirs were applied, general in amma- tory and immune pathways were restored back to the  Gy level for the mature microvessel model with  negative regulation in the angio- genesis cell model indicating that this countermeasure treatment diminished this response of GCR irradiation in the mature model (Fig. 9a). In mature 3D microvessel models, GCR radiation treatment sig- ni cantly upregulated several interferon-driven sensitive genes (ISGs), including DDX58, IFIH1, IFIT2, and to  lesser extent, IFIH1, IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3, IFIT5, IFITM1, IFITM3, OAS1- amongst others (Fig. 9b). Also upregulated by GCR radiation treatment were the cytokine/chemokine genes CXCL10 and CXCL11, which function as pro-in ammatory mole- cules associated with activation, differentiation, and chemotaxis of immune cells. In contrast, treatment with the antagomirs produced decreased levels of CXCL10 and CXCL11 and of all these ISG genes except for IFIH1 and OAS2. The NLRP3 in ammasome is  multiprotein complex formed by NLRP3, PYCARD and CASP1 that plays  pivotal role in regulating the innate immune system and in ammatory signaling. Upon activation by cytosolic danger signals, the NLRP3 in ammasome activates CASP1 triggering the maturation of IL- , NF-  activation, and the initiation of cell death via GSDMB52. GCR-treated cell cultures signi cantly upregulated NLRP3 and, to  lesser extent PYCARD, CASP1, and NFKB1, while treatment with antagomirs lessened the induction of these genes (Fig. 9b). Together, the increases in ISGs, cytokines/chemokines and NLRP3 in ammasome indicate that GCR radiation exposure promotes  robust innate immune response associated with increased produc- tion of pro-in ammatory molecules and immune cell activation. In contrast, the antagomir treatment downregulates and restores these factors back to normal levels. The adaptive immune genes were not signi cantly altered, consistent with the transient cell stress induced by the GCR treatment and potentially due to the fact that the 3D cell model does not contain any  cells (Fig. 9c). Mitochondrial damage mitigation after antagomir treatment with space radiation Mitochondrial stress has been previously implicated as  critical and consistently dysregulated phenotype during space ight12. Mitochon- dria play  crucial role in metabolism by integrating signals from stress and the environment, such as nutrient deprivation and oxidative stress, to coordinate cellular metabolism53. Thus, the MitoPathways collection54 was used to examine mitochondria-related activity in our 3D cell culture model. GCR exposure combined with antagomir treatment in the mature microvessels signi cantly decreased expres- sion of 106 of 149 available genesets (Fig. 10a). Radiation exposure alone did not signi cantly alter 72 of these genesets as highlighted in Fig. 10b. The largest of six major networks involves metabolism-linked MitoPathways where antagomirs with GCR exposure over- whelmingly downregulated 44 of 50 genesets (Fig. 10b). Negative enrichment in  of  subpathways are associated with carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid, nucleotide, metal, vitamin, and sulfur metabolism as well as detoxi cation. The substantial metabolic alterations may depend on the changes affecting the mitochondria which were also largely downregulated indicating an overall decrease in cellular energetics. The OXPHOS and Mitochondrial Central Dogma Mito- Pathways include crucial factors for oxidative phosphorylation functions (Complexes - subunits and assembly factors) and pro- teins encoded within mitochondrial DNA and factors involved in their expression, respectively. These genesets were nearly all decreased when antagomirs were added to the radiation exposure. The increased enrichment of  subpathways by radiation treatment alone (OXPHOS and OXPHOS subunits, CI and CV subunits, Complex , Mitochondrial Ribosome, and Translation) was completely reversed with the antagomirs. In response to stress stimuli, eukaryotic cells activate the inte- grated stress response (ISR) to restore cellular homeostasis via com- munication between organelles55. The communication between the mitochondria and the nucleus is essential for cellular homeostasis42, due to the large number of mitochondrial proteins encoded by the nucleus. Considering the observed decrease in mitochondrial and changes in stress pathways, the ISR genes were examined in more detail. GCR exposure in the mature 3D cell cultures downregulated ISR genes involved in amino acid uptake/biosynthesis, death factors, endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (ER-UPR) activa- tion, and lipid metabolism, while only ISR survival genes were Article  Nature Communications| (2024) 15:4825\n\npositivity enriched (Fig. 10c). Fewer genesets were affected by GCR exposure, which increased the ATF4 targets geneset and decreased ER- homeostasis. Initiation of the ISR is driven by the activation of the kinases HRI (EIF2AK1), PKR (EIF2AK2), PERK (EIF2AK3), or GCN2 (EIK2AK4) which occurs in the mature cell model with GCR radiation (Fig. 10d). These kinases phosphorylate eIF2 , impairing cytosolic protein synthesis and activating expression of the ISR transcription factors ATF4, ATF5, and CHOP.",

For irradiation combined with the antagomirs, genesets are returned to baseline. These results suggest that cells activate ISR as an adaptive cellular response after exposure to space radiation, whereas this activation is prevented by the antagomirs (Fig. 10d). Discussion Our previous study13 15 demonstrated  signi cant association between circulating miRNAs and space ight-associated health risks. These 13 circulating miRNAs were connected to the immune system, cellular differentiation, motility, proliferation, and survival13,15. Three miRNAs, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, were linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease during space ight13,15,56. collapse of microvessels in 3D cell cultures after exposure to space radiation13,21 was associated with breakdown of the endothelial barrier and the loss of tight junctions57. GCR-induced inhibition of microvessels during angiogenesis was dependent on the linear energy transfer (LET) of the charged particles58,59. Although the microvessel cells are post-mitotic, differential effects on DNA repair occur according to radiation quality (.. LET)20. The mixed simpli ed simulation of GCR uses  ve ions of different energies (Hydrogen, Helium, Oxygen, Silicon, and Iron)48 which are highly effective at inhibiting angiogenesis14.

Article  Nature Communications| (2024) 15:4825\n\nSeveral studies have shown the cellular consequences of miRNA activity, including the three miRNAs researched in the present study. Let-7a is involved in many cellular processes, immunity, and protective functions60. The majority of cellular processes involving let-7a are well studied in development, proliferation, differentiation, and cancer, but its role in in ammation, cardiovascular diseases, and/or stroke are not well understood61. Let-7a is involved in hematopoietic stem and pro- genitor cell homeostasis such as self-renewal, proliferation, quies- cence, and differentiation by blocking the TGF  pathway and amplifying Wnt signaling62. MicroRNA 16 (miR-16) is linked to human malignancies63 and can modulate the cell cycle, inhibit cell proliferation, promote cellular apoptosis, and suppress tumorigenicity64. The targets of miR-16 may be directly responsible for these effects such as the anti-apoptotic gene BCL- (-cell lymphoma )65, numerous genes involved in the G1- transition, such as cyclin D1, cyclin D3, cyclin E1 and CDK6 (cyclin- dependent kinase ), and genes involved in the Wnt signaling pathway, such as WNT3A (wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 3A)66. In endothelial cells, angiogenic factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), VEGF receptor- (VEGFR2), and  broblast growth factor receptor- (FGFR1), were identi ed by bioin- formatic approaches and subsequently validated as targets by miR-1667. The miR-125 family plays an important role in the growth and development of animals, as well as stress response, p53 activation68 and the occurrence and development of cancer69. In addition, the role of miR-125 in cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases cannot be ignored. The miR-125 family is associated with the development and differentiation of mammalian embryonic hearts70. Furthermore, it plays an important role in diseases and pathophysiological processes such as, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, ischemia- reperfusion injury, stroke, myocardial  brosis, endothelial cell injury and myocardial cell apoptosis70. recent paper has described the presence of miR-125b in osteoblast-derived matrix vesicles (MVs)71 and in bone matrix where it hampers osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption by targeting PRDM1 (PR domain zinc  nger protein ), thus suggesting that miR-125b might have an active role in the development of vascular calci cations72. All three miRNAs were initially found to be associated with cancer and neoplasia. However, unregulated cell cycle control is unlikely to be the only pathway that mitigates the biological effects of GCR. Our results from the mature microvessel model support this notion, since mature microvessels are postmitotic and the timing of events is too rapid to be downstream of cell cycle control, although this does not rule out an indirect involvement of cell cycle proteins. At 24  after GCR irradiation and 48  after antagomir treatment, protection of microvessel morphology is observed compared to the GCR-stressed control not treated with antagomirs. Individual inhibition of each target miRNA and the resulting mitigation of GCR effects suggests that each miRNA is similarly effective and therefore the targets of each must contain genes that are active in this process. Twelve of 21 key genes targeted by at least two of the three miRNAs (Fig. 5a) are potential candidates for protecting the microvessel physiology. These include genes involved in apoptosis and p53-mediated cell death, cell cycle and mitotic phase transitions, innate immune response, and mitochondrial processes related with Fig. 10 | Mitigation of mitochondrial dysregulation and integrated stress response (ISR) with antagomir treatment on mature and angiogenesis 3D cell culture models irradiated with GCR.

However, apoptosis is not measurable in these cultures as much higher doses of heavy and light ions are needed to detect this mechanism21 by TUNEL assay although this does not rule out earlier apoptosis signal- ing. Direct action of genes involved in the cell cycle and mitotic phase transitions is unlikely in mature microvessels. Involvement of cellular programs from the innate immune response is  possibility, since immune-associated genes seem to be heavily regulated by space radiation and miRNAs. The effects of the antagomir cocktail on sup- pressing DNA repair indicates  much earlier time of action, likely upstream of the rescue of angiogenesis or the protection of mature vessels. This suggests that early response genes involved in radiation exposure might be targets for the antagomirs; these would include genes of general in ammatory and immune pathways. There are  genes that are affected in common with all  antagomirs. When inhibited, all products of these genes are candidates for mediating the resistance to radiation damage, although the effects of other genes affected by each individual antagomir cannot be ruled out. Each gene has functions that could contribute to GCR resistance. APAF1 and NIBAN1 are involved in the control of apoptosis and may prevent progression towards senescence73. XPO6 and SLC7A1 are involved in transport across membranes between cell compartments,  process involved in early responses to cell stressors74,75. PDPR regulates pyr- uvate phosphorylation and may facilitate protective functions that require  higher energy output76. Overall it appears that several path- ways are involved in protection and are acting in concert to push the cells into  more healthy and active biological state. Changes in immune response appear to be  hallmark of space radiation and targeted by miRNAs. We previously have shown that cytotoxic and helper  cells are suppressed and key innate immune response-related factors are dysregulated in C57BL/ female mice exposed to . Gy GCR irradiation14. Markers of CD4 (helper) and CD8 (cytotoxic)  cell populations in the I4 astronauts (Fig. 6j, ) also indicate dysregulation occurring during space ight. The similarities between both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate  paral- lelism that gives con dence about using the 3D cell culture model to con rm the effectiveness of the antagomir treatment strategy to pre- vent and countermeasure space radiation damage. Space ight can affect mitochondrial stability12. The ability of antagomirs to rescue mitochondria-associated pathways affected by radiation indicates the potential for using these antagomirs to rescue harmful phenotypes in space travelers. In particular, the OXPHOS pathway, which was downregulated upon treatment with GCR-stress, showed  rescue-like effect (Fig. 10). Impaired OXPHOS can lead to cell death due to insuf cient ATP for energy use, changes in mitochondrial membrane potential or overproduction of prooxidant agents77. Elec- tron carriers, like the amidoxime-reducing complex, assists in this process and show downregulation in the presence of radiation. This radiation phenotype has the potential to progress to in ammation. Speci cally, the genes whose upregulation was returned to normal by the addition of antagomir include those of complex , complex , and other OXPHOS subunits. Genotoxic stress caused by ionizing or UV radiations is  potent inducer of cellular senescence. Curiously, GCR suppresses most of the pathways associated with cellular senescence curated based on data from  broblasts, renal epithelial cells and adipocytes induced to senescence by different stimuli, including -ray irradiation, oncogene overexpression, antiretroviral drug or hyperinsulinemia50,51. This sug- gests that either GCR does suppress classical cellular senescence or GCR-induced senescence in our 3D cell culture differs from the pre- viously studied mechanisms of senescence induction by radiation (Supplementary Fig. ). The latter is supported by previous evidence demonstrating that different senescence stimuli drive very distinct phenotypes51. The only senescence-related pathway induced by GCR in our model is oncogene-induced senescence, which is consistent with activation of p53 target genes. The antagomirs have no effect on the mature culture model, but in the irradiated angiogenesis model they promote various senescence-related pathways. Future studies are required to assess the role of these miRNAs in senescence induction by more classical stimuli. Future studies are also required, as stated above, to decipher GCR effect on multicellular microvascular models, in which differential irradiation effect on the different cell population ( broblast/pericyte and endothelial cells for example) might impaired, or not, paracrine communication and then the global effect in vivo (human). The interplay between orphan genes and miRNAs has not been previously studied. We observe  signi cant change in orphan gene expression from GCR irradiation stress and from antagomir treatment (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. ).",

    "text": "This sug- gests that either GCR does suppress classical cellular senescence or GCR-induced senescence in our 3D cell culture differs from the pre- viously studied mechanisms of senescence induction by radiation (Supplementary Fig. ). The latter is supported by previous evidence demonstrating that different senescence stimuli drive very distinct phenotypes51. The only senescence-related pathway induced by GCR in our model is oncogene-induced senescence, which is consistent with activation of p53 target genes. The antagomirs have no effect on the mature culture model, but in the irradiated angiogenesis model they promote various senescence-related pathways. Future studies are required to assess the role of these miRNAs in senescence induction by more classical stimuli. Future studies are also required, as stated above, to decipher GCR effect on multicellular microvascular models, in which differential irradiation effect on the different cell population ( broblast/pericyte and endothelial cells for example) might impaired, or not, paracrine communication and then the global effect in vivo (human). The interplay between orphan genes and miRNAs has not been previously studied. We observe  signi cant change in orphan gene expression from GCR irradiation stress and from antagomir treatment (Fig. 4d and Supplementary Fig. ). Many orphan genes were upregu- lated in the 3D mature microvessel cell culture and interestingly, downregulated in the angiogenesis model. Some of these orphan genes may be integrated into the metabolic and regulatory processes that are targeted by the miRNAs. Orphan genes themselves are simple proteins that often act by binding to conserved proteins such as transcription factors or receptors31,78. Some orphan genes are key for reproduction, some are toxins, and many confer resistance to stress30,31,79 82, however, orphan genes do not appear to encode enzymes, likely because of the very long time scale required for evo- lution of  specialized catalytic site82. Many orphan genes are expres- sed to high levels only in discrete tissues or under speci  abiotic stresses or diseases30,32,79,82,83. The alteration of orphan gene expression with GCR irradiation and antagomir treatment warrants further examination. Due to the nature of performing experiments in the space envir- onment, it can be limiting and dif cult to simulate perfectly the con- ditions in space in ground experiments. So to perfectly recreate the space radiation dose and dose-rate that astronauts will receive during long-duration space ights (lasting several months) is not possible. The ground-based experimental setup reported in this manuscript used for irradiating with GCRs currently represents the best approximation for validation of predictive models and while enabling countermeasure developments. Thus, extrapolation and comparison from the astro- naut data to cell culture studies conducted on Earth as well as mice experiments both on Earth and during space ight are key to mean- ingful interpretation of biological results applicable to space  ight. Lastly, it is possible that the differences in the radiation delivery might account for any deviations between the results we are observing. The present microvascularized model is  simpli ed system hosting endothelial cells only and one shall point out the absence of the very important pericytes. Indeed, it is well known that when endothelial cells organize into microvascular networks (during angiogenesis), stromal cells associate with newly formed microvessels to stabilize the structure. Fibroblasts can play this role by adopting  pericytic-type phenotype84 86. To push forward the full understanding of the GCR effect on angiogenesis, it might be necessary, in  close future, to complexify the model, at least toward  multicellular compartment87. In addition, it will be essential for future studies to test the toxicity of the antagomirs in in vivo models, since the tissue model utilized for this manuscript is limited for this purpose. The inhibition of three miRNAs, miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let- 7a-5p, facilitates the reduction of cellular damage from ionizing radiation exposure. Treatment with antagomirs that inhibited these three miRNAs before and after radiation exposure in mature and angiogenesis 3D human HUVEC cell culture models, completely pre- vented the microvessel collapse and inhibition of microvessel devel- opment caused by GCR exposure. The potential effectiveness of these antagomirs to reduce prolonged tissue damage through modi ed DNA repair activity and alterations in cellular mitochondria offers  unique target for the development of radiation countermeasures for space-  ight as well as for terrestrial applications.

National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All methods were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations and are reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. All human studies were done with ethical approvals with estab- lished and approved IRBs and according to the criteria set by the Declaration of Helsinki. The Inspiration4 (I4) mission was performed at Weill Cornell Medicine. Blood samples were provided by SpaceX Inspiration4 crew members after informed consent for research use. The procedure followed guidelines set by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operated under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols and informed consent was obtained. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local reg- ulations and with the approval of the IRB at the Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569). All crewmembers consented to data and sample sharing. The NASA Twin Study subjects signed informed consent accord- ing to the declaration of Helsinki and 14 CFR Part 1230 for collection and use of sample materials and data in research protocols at NASA and the collaborating institutions. Study protocols were approved by the NASA Flight Institutional Review Board (protocol number Pro1245) and all participating institutions. Also the data is hosted at the NASA Life Sciences Data Archive (LSDA). Informed consent was provided by all participants in the NASA Twin Study. The JAXA astronaut data was obtained from NASA  GeneLab Platform and this study used only published aggregated quanti cation values. Cell culture Prior to culturing 3D microvessels, HUVEC (Lonza Inc, Allendale, NJ, USA), primary cells isolated from the vein of the umbilical cord were cultured as 2D monolayers in complete endothelial basal medium (EBM; Lonza Inc., Allendale, NJ, USA), containing EGM medium (serum free) supplemented with % fetal bovine serum (FBS), human epi- dermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, and bovine brain extract. Cells were kept in  humidi ed incubator (% CO2, 95% air) and the medium was changed twice  week. All cells used for experiments were cells thawed from  fresh vial. 3D HUVEC vessel cell model In this study, 3D cell culture was performed according to the method initially described by Davis et al.88 with modi cations described in Grabham et al.21. Brie ,  collagen gel solution (Rat tail Collagen Type , BD Biosciences, Bedford MA) was prepared on ice by mixing toge- ther the following stock solutions: .35% collagen solution, 10  ~ M199 medium, and   HEPES (pH .) in  ratio of :: by (volume). This solution was then mixed with matrigel (BD Biosciences, Bedford, MA) in  ratio of : by (volume). HUVECs grown in EGM on 2D cell culture dishes (80 90% con uence) were detached with  trypsin solution (.025%) and resuspended in EGM- (Lonza Inc, Allendale, NJ, USA). The cell solution was mixed with the gel solution in  ratio : (by volume). The resulting cell suspension contained   nal cell suspen- sion of  106 cells/ml. 25   was dropped onto the cell growing surface inside  tissue culture  ask (T25) (Corning) and allowed to gel at 37   for 30 min. The gel matrices were then overlaid with EGM- medium for  days with daily media changes. EBM- consists of EGM- media supplemented with % FBS, human  broblast growth factor  (hFGF- ), human epidermal growth factor (hEGF), human vascular endothe- lial cell growth factor (hVEGF), long  insulin-like growth factor  (R3-IGF-), ascorbic acid, hydrocortisone and heparin. 50 nM Phorbol 12- Myristate 13-acetate (PMA) (Millipore Sigma) was also added to the growth media. Cells embedded in 200 300-  thick gel matrices were incubated at 37   in  humidi ed incubator (% CO2, 95% air) for the times indicated. The medium was refreshed every 24  or as otherwise stated in individual experiments. For mature microvessels, cells were cultured for  days and treated with AUMantagomirTM (AUM biotech) (. each) 24  before radiation exposure then  xed 24  later. For the angiogenesis model, cultures were irradiated on day one and cultured for  more days before  xation. Preliminary experiments showed that antagomir treatment on days  and  were most effective. For DNA damage/repair (.. 53BP1 staining), cultures were  xed at 90 min after irradiations. Simulated Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR) exposure Irradiation of microvessel models and animals were conducted at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL, Upton, NY). Samples were positioned in the plateau region of the Bragg curve and irradiated at room temperature. Dosi- metry was performed by the NSRL physics staff. For microvessel models, cultures were seeded at Columbia University in New York City then transported to BNL the same day. Irradiations were carried out the following day (Day ) at NSRL. 20 cm   20 cm beam was utilized. Since the heavy-ion beam at NSRL is horizontal,  asks containing  ml of medium were upended to  vertical position for  few minutes during irradiation. All cultures were irradiated with . Gy of simpli ed simulated GCR (referred to as GCR). The irradiation was used with ions, energy, and doses determined by  NASA consensus formula for  ions: protons at 1000 MeV, 28Si at 600 MeV/,4He at 250 MeV/, 16O at 350 MeV/, 56Fe at 600 MeV/, and protons at 250 MeV, in the fol- lowing proportions   1000 MeV protons at 34.%, 250 MeV protons at 39.%, 28Si at .%, 4He at 18%, 16O at .%, and 56Fe at %. This mixture is the simpli ed version of the full GCR simulation and represents the proportions of ions found in space and thus translates to exploratory class missions48. The low LET particles (Protons and Helium) make up the majority of charged particles although high LET ions generally have  greater relative biological effect (RBE). Quanti cation of 3D human cell culture models after irradiation: Immunocytochemistry, Imaging, and microvessel analysis All microvessel cultures were  xed and stained as for monolayers. Fixed in % paraformaldehyde followed by three washes in Phosphate buffered saline (PBS) with .% Triton-, and  nally in PBS. -(,- Dichlorotriazinyl) Amino uorescein (DTAF) (Thermo sher Scienti ) was used to as   uorescent green stain for all proteins to visualize microvessels (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). 53BP1 foci were immu- nostained using  polyclonal antibody against 53BP1 (Catalog #: NB100-304, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO, USA) and  counterstain for nuclei with YOYO green (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) followed by Alexa  uor conjugates 495 or 488 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Images were captured on  Nikon TE 200 confocal C1 microscope with EZ-C1 software. Analysis of images was carried out using NIH Image  . .44k software68. Initial analysis on microvessels was carried out on randomly selected 20X  elds from within the gel matrix. Thresholded images of microvessels were outlined as perimeters then divided by  for length measurements. For the improved analysis the  eld size was increased -fold by using images captured by  10  objective. The mature microvessels were de ned more rigorously as those of  minimum diameter of 12. . This step eliminated many immature thin vessels and reduced the effective doses. Finally, the sample  elds were standardized, by imaging microvessels at  constant depth (50 mm above the substrate). All analyses were carried out blind. DNA double strand break repair foci assay was carried out by counting the number of foci per nucleus.

We compiled all genes related to these into  master list and deleted any duplicated genes. We then utilized the ClueGO+CluePedia plugin90,91 in Cytoscape92 to map the relation- ship between the gene targets for the three miRNAs. This was done by including all DNA DSB genes and the three miRNAs in the initial query list. The edges and connections were made with CluePedia utilizing the following miRNA-mRNA databases in the plugin: CluePedia STRING- Actions (.11.0_9606_27.02.2019), CluePedia microRNA.org-human predictions_s_O_aug2020, miRDB_v6., miRanda-miRNAs v5-2012-07- 19, mirTarBase, and mirecords.umn.edu.validated.miRNAs-2010-11-25. Nucleic acid extraction for 3D human cell culture models We used  =  biological replicates for each condition for RNA-seq. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Universal kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Gel matrix cryotubes containing the cells of interest were taken out of  80   and  mL of QIAzol reagent was added to the tubes. Each sample contained 300 800   of gel matrix and approximately 500,000 cells. While the gel matrix thawed in QIAzol, the solution was pipetted and vortexed until fully dissolved. The lysate was passed through  QIAshredder column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) to further homogenize the cells. 100   of gDNA eliminator solution was added. The resulting lysate from each sample was then used to isolate and purify RNA following the manufacturer protocol. RNA was eluted in 30 50   RNAse free H2O. Concentration of all RNA samples were measured using Qubit . Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scienti , Waltham, MA) with Qubit RNA BR kit following SOP .-RNA/DNA/ miRNA/cDNA Quanti cation using Qubit Fluorimeter93. RNA quality was assessed using the Agilent 4200 TapeStation with the Agilent RNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). Spike in Protocols before library preparation in 3D cultures ERCC ExFold RNA Spike-In Mixes (Thermo Fisher Scienti , Waltham, MA, Cat 4456739, v92), Mix  or Mix , were added on the day of library prep at the concentrations suggested by the manufacturer protocol. SOP . Use of ERCC Spike-In Mixes and UMRR/UHRR Controls for Total RNA Sequencing93. Library construction for RNA-sequencing on 3D cultures RNA ribo-depletion and library preparation was done with Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Gold (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA). Input RNA were approximately 500 ng with RIN > . (average RIN of .). Index adapters used were at . (IDT, 384-well xGen Dual Index UMI Adapters). 15 PCR cycles were performed. Library fragment size was assessed using Agilent 4200 TapeStation with D1000 DNA ScreenTape (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) following GeneLab SOP . Quality analysis of sequencing libraries using 4200 TapeSta- tion System with D1000 reagent kit93. Pooled library concentration was measured by Qubit  Fluorometer (ThermoFisher Scienti , Waltham, MA) following SOP .-RNA/DNA/miRNA/cDNA Quanti cation using Qubit Fluorimeter. Library quality assessment was performed on iSeq100 (Illumina, San Diego, CA). Bulk RNA-sequencing and data processing on 3D cultures RNA sequencing was performed by GeneLabSample Processing Lab on Illumina NovaSeq 6000. Sequencing was set up as follows: Read : 151 bp, Index1: 17 bp( bp index + bp UMI), Index2:  bp Read : 151 bp. PhiX was included as an internal control and to increase library diversity. Protocol followed is SOP .-Setting up NovaSeq 6000 and iSeq 100 Sequencers93. Raw fastq  les were assessed for percent rRNA using HTStream SeqScreener (version ..) and  ltered using Trim Galore! (version ..) powered by Cutadapt (version .). Raw and trimmed fastq  le quality was evaluated with FastQC (version .11.), and MultiQC (ver- sion .12) was used to generate MultiQC reports. Homo sapiens STAR and RSEM references were built using STAR (version ..10a) and RSEM (version ..), respectively, Ensembl release 101, genome version GRCh38 (Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.primary_assembly.fa) con- catenated with ERCC92.fa from ThermoFisher ( thermo sher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip), and the fol- lowing gtf annotation  le: Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.101.gtf con- catenated with the ERCC92.gtf  le from ThermoFisher ( thermo sher.com/TFS-Assets/LSG/manuals/ERCC92.zip). Trimmed reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens + ERCC STAR reference with STAR (version ..10a) and aligned reads were assessed for stranded- ness using RSeQC Infer Experiment (version ..) then aligned reads from all samples were quanti ed using RSEM (version ..), with strandedness set to forward. pyrpipe was used for quanti cation of the orphan genes and other EB genes23,69. Using DESeq2, the likelihood ratio test (LRT) was performed separately for the  conditions on each 3D microvessel cell culture model. Quanti cation data was imported to  (version ..) with tximport (version .22.) and normalized with DESeq2 (version .34.) median of ratios method. The data was nor- malized twice, each time using  different size factor. The  rst used non-ERCC genes for size factor estimation, and the second used only ERCC group  genes to estimate the size factor. Both sets of normal- ized gene counts were subject to differential expression analysis. Dif- ferential expression analysis was performed in  (version ..) using DESeq2 (version .34.); all groups were compared using the log2(Fold- Change) values and the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test was used to generate the  statistic -value. Gene annotations were assigned using the following Bioconductor and annotation packages: STRINGdb (v2..), PANTHER.db (v1..11), and org.Hs.eg.db (v3.15.). We have utilized for our analysis  -value < .05 for statistical signi cance and acknowledge the potential of more false positives to occur. All TPM values can be found in Supplemental Data . Raw RNA-seq data is available on the NASA OSDR  Biological Data Management Environment94 with accession number: OSD-577. Determination of the 21 key gene targets for the three miRNAs, cumulative plots for the miRNA targets, and statistical test To determine the 21 key gene targets for miR-16-5p, miR-125b-5p, and let-7a-5p, we found the genes that were statistically signi cantly downregulated for . Gy vs  Gy and no longer signi cant for . Gy with antagomir vs  Gy. We then utilized mirDIP95 to determine the gene targets for all  miRNAs with  criteria of medium score class. The medium score class has been shown in the literature to provide  reasonable criteria for determining gene targets for miRNAs35. We overlapped these two lists of genes and found 21 genes. The 21 gene fold-change values, statistics, and TPM values can be found in Sup- plemental Data . We used the  Target Mining  function of the online platform miRwalk96. It allowed searching the 21 gene targets against the three miRNAs (hsa-miR-125b, hsa-let-7a and hsa-miR-16), and investigate their  -,  -UTR and coding sequence (CDS) regions with  binding probability cutoff of at least .75 (Sankey plot part of Fig. 5b ). To this, we have added the genes  respective log2 fold change given  GCR (. Gy) and Sham control ( Gy). To build the cumulative plots for the 21 miRNA gene targets, we obtained the information about whether these genes have 7mer or 8mer sites that match the seed region of each the three miRNAs (hsa- miR-125b, hsa-let-7a and hsa-miR-16) using the TargetScan v8. database97. mRNAs were then grouped according to miRNA seed sequences (7mer-1A, 7mer-m8 or 8mer or  no site ), and the cumulative plot was generated using the mRNA log2 fold change values using the Article  Nature Communications| (2024) 15:4825\n\necdfplot method from seaborn98. To compare distributions of mRNA fold change values for each seed match with the  no site  case, we calculated the Kolmogorov Smirnov test using the kstest function from scipy in python99. To determine the experimental validation for the 21 gene targets to the miRNAs, we utilized three databases which are: miRTarBase v9.037, TarBase v9.038, and StarBase v2.039. Both TarBase and miRTar- Base include literature references for the experimental validation. We also provided additional literature references for some genes as indi- cated in Supplementary Table . We displayed these results both in Supplementary Table  and as bar plots (Fig. 5j) using ggplot2 (ver ..). Conserved miRNA analysis between humans and mice Selected precursor and mature miRNA sequences from human and mouse were extracted from miRBase .22.1100. After BLASTN align- ment, conservation between mouse and human sequences was determined as the percentage of aligned nucleotide identities in mature and pre-miRNA sequences. RTPCR on key gene targets Total RNA samples were prepared from the same RNA isolated for the bulk RNA-seq as described above and were DNase  treated using TRIzol according to the manufacturer  instructions. cDNA synthesis was performed using the BioRad iScript Reverse Transcription Supermix. To quantify gene expression of genes using TaqMan probes BioRad iTaq Universal Probes Supermix was used to perform quan- titative real-time PCR. To quantify gene expression of genes using DNA probes BioRad iTaq Universal SYBR  Green Supermix was used to perform quantitative real-time PCR. ACTB, GAPDH, and 18S were used as an internal reference. Quantitative real-time PCR reactions were performed on an BioRad CFX384 Real-Time PCR Instrument. Delta- delta-cycle threshold ( CT) was determined relative to ACTB, GAPDH, and 18S levels and normalized to control samples. Error bars indicate the standard deviation of the mean from at least three bio- logical replicates. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) For pathway analysis, we utilized fast Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (fGSEA)101. Pathway analysis was done utilizing both MSigDB gene sets46 (speci cally, Hallmark and KEGG) and custom-made Gene Set  les from MitoPathway and expert-curated mitochondrial genes available in89. Using fGSEA, all samples were compared to controls and the ranked list of genes was de ned by the -score statistics. The sta- tistical signi cance was determined by 1000 permutations of the genesets89. We utilized  statistical cutoff of FDR < .05 as recom- mended by GSEA and lollipop plots were made using ggplot2 (ver ..). All GSEA data generated for this manuscript can be found in Supplemental Data . Murine simulated space environment experiments The murine data utilized here were from experiments previously reported by Malkani et al.13 and Paul et al.14. All experiments were approved by Brookhaven National Laboratory  (BNL) Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (protocol number: 506) and all experiments were performed by trained personnel in AAALAC accredited animal facilities at BNL, while conforming to the .. National Institutes of Health Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. All methods were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations and are reported in accordance with ARRIVE guidelines. Brie ,  = 80 15-week +/ -day old, C57Bl/6J wildtype female mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories and housed at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL, Upton, NY). Upon arrival to BNL, mice were quarantined and acclimated to  standard 12:12  light:dark cycle, with controlled temperature/humidity for -week prior to cage acclimation. Food and water were given ad libi- tum, and standard bedding was changed once per week. The normally loaded (NL) mice were originally utilized in parallel experiments with hindlimb unloaded mice which were not reported in this manuscript. Mice were cage acclimated ( = 10 mice per group;  mice per cage to maintain social interaction) -days prior to HU, followed by 14-days either normally loaded (NL) or hindlimb unloaded. Irradiation was administered on day 13 and blood tissues were collected at 24- post- irradiation and post-euthanasia by CO2 overdose, followed by cervical dislocation.

Blood was collected via the abdominal aorta in EDTA- coated tubes (. ) and plasma was separated by centrifugation at 2000    for 15 min. Plasma was collected and  ash frozen in liquid nitrogen for  80   storage. 100   aliquot of cellular fraction was  ash frozen and stored at  80   for RNA analyses, while the remaining cellular fraction was lysed with   RBC lysis buffer (Thermo Fisher Scienti ) followed by  ow cytometric preparation and analyses, as described below. All organs were  ash frozen and collected at the time of dissection. All tissues were stored at  80  . Body weight tracking was performed on days  , ,  and 14. On day 13, mice were transported on BNL base to the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL) facility by animal care staff and were transferred to individual HU boxes. The following doses of irradiation were administered; GCR (. Gy) and Sham control ( Gy). Mice were positioned in the plateau region of the Bragg curve and irradiated at room temperature in individual HU boxes to enable whole body irra- diation while maintaining hindlimb suspension. The NSRL physics staff performed the dosimetry. This dose of radiation is equivalent to what an astronaut is predicted to receive in deep space during  Mars mis- sion, though it is modeled as  single exposure over 25 min instead of the actual chronic exposures over . years. 60   60 beam was uti- lized at the NSRL for irradiation. Sham controls were treated similarly to GCR irradiated mice, including HU cage boxes and beam line (without irradiation) for the same duration as GCR simulation, .. 25 min. miRNA extraction from murine tissues MiRNA extractions from plasma and all tissues were carried out using the Qiagen miRNeasy serum/plasma kit (Cat# 217184). MiRNA extrac- tions from dissolved microvessel constructs were carried out using the Qiagen miRNeasy Mini Kit (Cat# 217004). Quantitation of miRNA samples was done using  NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher Scienti ). miRNA sequencing on murine samples Library construction and sequencing was performed from miRNAs isolated from plasma, liver, heart, and soleus muscle from the mouse experiments described above. The miRNA extraction was carried out using the QIAgen miRNeasy kit (#217004). The total RNA quality and quantity were analyzed using  Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, CA, USA) with RIN number >. Approximately    of total RNA was used to prepare  small RNA library according to the protocol of TruSeq Small RNA Sample Prep Kits (Illumina, San Diego, USA). Single-end sequen- cing was performed using 50 bp on an Illumina Hiseq 2500 at the LC Sciences (Hangzhou, China) following the vendor  recommended protocol. All miRNA-sequence raw data was deposited on NASA OSDR  Biological Data Management Environment with the following identi ers: for all heart tissue related data: OSD-334, DOI: 10.26030/ cg2g-as49; for all liver tissue related data: OSD-335, DOI: 10.26030/ 72ke-1k67: for all soleus muscle related data: OSD-337, DOI: 10.26030/ m73g-2477; and for all plasma related data: OSD-336, DOI: 10.26030/ qasa-rr29. Analysis of miRNA sequencing from murine samples Raw reads were subjected to an in-house software program, ACGT101-miR (LC Sciences, Houston, Texas, USA) to remove Article  Nature Communications| (2024) 15:4825\n\nadapter dimers, junk, low complexity, common RNA families (rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA) and repeats. Subsequently, unique sequen- ces with length in 18~26 nucleotide were mapped to speci  species precursors in miRBase 22.0100 by BLAST search to identify known miRNAs and novel 3p- and 5p- derived miRNAs. Length variation at both   and   ends and one mismatch inside of the sequence were allowed in the alignment. The unique sequences mapping to speci  species mature miRNAs in hairpin arms were identi ed as known miRNAs. The unique sequences mapping to the other arm of known speci  species precursor hairpin opposite to the annotated mature miRNA-containing arm were considered to be novel 5p- or 3p- derived miRNA candidates. The remaining sequences were mapped to other selected species precursors (with the exclusion of speci  species) in miRBase 22. by BLAST search, and the mapped pre- miRNAs were further BLASTed against the speci  species genomes to determine their genomic locations. The above two were de ned as known miRNAs. The unmapped sequences were BLASTed against the speci  genomes, and the hairpin RNA structures containing sequences were predicated from the  ank 80 nt sequences using RNAfold software ( RNAfold.cgi). The criteria for secondary structure prediction were: () number of nucleotides in one bulge in stem ( 12); () number of base pairs in the stem region of the predicted hairpin ( 16); () cutoff of free energy (kCal/mol  15); () length of hairpin (up and down stems + terminal loop  50); () length of hairpin loop ( 20); () number of nucleotides in one bulge in mature region ( ); () number of biased errors in one bulge in mature region ( ); () number of biased bulges in mature region ( ); () number of errors in mature region ( ); (10) number of base pairs in the mature region of the predicted hairpin ( 12); and (11) percent of mature in stem ( 80). Differential expression of miRNAs based on normalized deep-sequencing counts was analyzed by selectively using Fisher exact test, Chi-squared     test, Chi-squared nXn test, Student   test, or ANOVA based on the experimental design. The signi cance threshold was set to be .01 and .05 in each test. To determine gene ontology (GO)102 and C2 pathways being regulated by the miRNAs, we performed miRNA gene set analysis uti- lizing the RbiomirGS23 v0..12  package from the processed miRNA analysis for all conditions in the plasma and heart tissues. The Rbio- mirGS package has been extensively shown in the literature to provide strong pathway prediction that provide strong biological results103 106. From the pathways we chose an FDR < .25 cutoff for signi cantly regulated pathways. We plotted the speci  pathways with  package ggplot2. Weighted Gene Co-expression Analysis (WGCNA) of miRNAs-seq murine data Weighted Gene Co-expression Analysis (WGCNA) was performed on the OSDR-334, OSDR-335, OSDR-336, and OSDR-337 miRNA-Seq data- sets. First, the miRNA-Seq datasets were merged and outlier samples and genes were removed based on manual inspection using hier- archical clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and the built- in WGCNA goodSamplesGenes() function. Then Variance Stabilizing Transformation (VST) was performed using the  Bioconductor package, DESeq2 version .38.. The  Bioconductor package, WGCNA version .72- was used to perform WGCNA following the standard protocol as detailed in the package vignette. NASA Twin Study data RNA-seq analysis Speci  details related to all the methods related to the NASA Twin Study RNA-seq data can be found in the following references13,17. Brie , we will highlight the key methods. The NASA Twins Study involved two male twin subjects, aged 50 years old at the time of launch. The  ight twin spent 340 days aboard the ISS while his identical twin stayed on Earth as the ground control. Blood samples were collected into  mL CPT (Cell Preparation Tube with Sodium HeparinN) tubes (BD Biosciences Cat # 362760) per manufacturer  recommendations. Cell separation was performed by centrifugation in at 1800    for 20 min at room temperature, both on the ISS and for the ground-based samples. Ambient blood collected samples slated for immediate return on Soyuz capsule were stored at    until processing (average of 35 37  after collection, including repatriation time). Samples collected on Earth and the ISS and planned for long-term storage were mixed by inversion and immediately frozen at  80 oC. Fresh processing of CPT tubes was performed using the following steps: . plasma was retrieved from the CPT tubes and  ash frozen prior to long term storage at  80 oC. . The peripheral blood mono- nuclear cells (PBMCs) were recovered and washed in PBS. . million PBMCs were retrieved from one pre- ight and one post- ight samples, pelleted,  ash frozen and stored at  80 oC until use for RNA extrac- tions. The  ow through from cell sorting steps was recovered as the lymphocyte depleted (LD) fraction; LD and PBMC cell specimens were lysed into RLT+ buffer (Qiagen Cat# 1053393),  ash frozen and stored at  80 oC until use. Details of transcriptome preparation, sequencing, and analysis were described previously17. NASA Twin Study data miRNA-seq analysis Speci  details related to all the methods related to the NASA Twin Study miRNA-seq data can be found in the following references13,17. Brie , we will highlight the key methods. Small RNA libraries were prepared from 50 ng total RNA using the NEBNext Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina (NEB #E7560) per manufacturer  recommendations with the following modi cations: adapters and RT primer were diluted four fold, 17 cycles of PCR were used for library ampli cation, and no size selection was performed. The i7 primers in the NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina Dual Index Primers (NEB# E7600, NEB#E7780) were used to supplement the index primers in NEB #E7560. The libraries were sequenced in an Illumina NextSeq instrument (1x50bp). Standard libraries were preprocessed and quality controlled using miRTrace107. Subsequently, reads were mapped against MirGeneDB sequences108 using the miRDeep2109 quanti er module. Expression values were normalized to reads per million (RPM) considering only miRNA counts. The normalized RPM value were utilized for all analysis. If the value for the miRNA was zero for all samples that miRNA was excluded from the analysis. To determine statistically signi cant miRNAs, ANOVA analysis with -value < . was independently per- formed for each cell type. For  ight only comparisons, the same sta- tistical signi cance was applied for all time points excluding the ground samples and all ambient return samples. All statistics were run independently for each cell condition/type. To determine the overlap of the miRNA signature in this paper with the Twin Study miRNA-seq data, the proposed miRNAs were used as well as all mature compo- nents of the miRNAs included in the miRNA family. Inspiration4 (i4) astronaut sample collection Detailed methods for sample collection and data processing are described in Overbey et al.19, and Kim et al.110. Blood samples were collected before (Pre-launch: -92, -44, and -) and after (Return;  + ,  + 45, and  + 82) the space ight. There were two male and two female astronauts for this mission. Chromium Next GEM Single Cell   v2, 10x Genomics was used to generate single cell data from isolated PBMCs. Subpopulations were annotated based on Azimuth human PBMC reference. In summary, blood samples were collected before (prelaunch; -92 days, 44 days, and  days) and after (return;  +  day,  + 45 days, and  + 82 days) the space ight. 21 miRNA target genes suggested in the paper has been used for identifying DEGs from i4 PBMCs and subpopulations. The Seurat method was used to normalize RNA count Article  Nature Communications| (2024) 15:4825\n\ndata and calculate average expression of each gene. We used the average expression of the genes from four astronauts comparing post-  ight ( + ) vs pre- ight (-92, -44, and -) to identify DEGs with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test ( < .05).",

Average expression of the 21 miRNA target genes was used to generate heatmap plotted by the pheatmap  package. Figure 6f was created with BioRender.com. For skin spatial transcriptomics data,  mm diameter skin biopsies were obtained from all Inspiration4 crew members, once before  ight and as soon as possible after return (-44 and  + ). These biopsies were  ash frozen and processed with the NanoString GeoMx platform. 20x scan was used to select 95 freeform regions of interest (ROIs) to guide selection of outer epidermal (OE), inner epidermal (IE), outer dermal (OD) and vascular (VA) regions. GeoMx WTA sequencing reads from NovaSeq6000 were compiled into FASTQ  les corresponding to each ROI and converted to digital count conversion  les using the NanoString GeoMx NGS DnD Pipeline. From the Q3 normalized count matrix that accounts for factors such as capture area, cellularity, and read quality, the DESeq2 method was used to perform differential expression analysis. The procedure followed guidelines set by Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and operated under Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved protocols and informed consent was obtained. Experiments were conducted in accordance with local regulations and with the approval of the IRB at the Weill Cornell Medicine (IRB #21-05023569). JAXA Cell-Free Epigenome (CFE) Study RNA quanti cation data Aggregated RNA differential expression data and study protocols were shared through NASA  Open Science Data Repository with accession number: OSD-53018. Plasma cell-free RNA samples for RNA-seq analysis were derived from blood samples collected from  astronauts before, during, and after the space ight on the ISS.

Abstract: Space ight causes cardiovascular changes due to microgravity-induced redistribution of body  uids and musculoskeletal unloading. Cardiac deconditioning and atrophy on Earth are associated with altered Trp53 and oxidative stress-related pathways, but the effects of space ight on cardiac changes at the molecular level are less understood. We tested the hypothesis that space ight alters the expression of key genes related to stress response pathways, which may contribute to cardiovascular deconditioning during extended space ight. Mice were exposed to space ight for 15 days or maintained on Earth (ground control). Ventricle tissue was harvested starting ~  post-landing. We measured expression of select genes implicated in oxidative stress pathways and Trp53 signaling by quantitative PCR. Cardiac expression levels of 37 of 168 genes tested were altered after space ight. Space ight downregulated transcription factor, Nfe2l2 (Nrf2), upregulated Nox1 and downregulated Ptgs2, suggesting  persistent increase in oxidative stress-related target genes. Space ight also substantially upregulated Cdkn1a (p21) and cell cycle/apoptosis-related gene Myc, and downregulated the in ammatory response gene Tnf. There were no changes in apoptosis-related genes such as Trp53. Space ight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance, cell cycle and senescence in cardiac tissue of mice. Thus, space ight may contribute to cardiac dysfunction due to oxidative stress. Keywords: space ight; microgravity; heart; gene expression; oxidative stress; Nfe2l2; NADPH oxidase; Ptgs2; Cdkn1a; Myc . Introduction Responses to space ight include cardiovascular de cits, loss of bone and muscle mass, compromised immune function, chromosomal aberrations and metabolic changes [ ]. With future lunar and interplanetary space missions, astronauts will stay in space for longer periods, presenting increased cardiovascular risk to the crew. Therefore,  better understanding of molecular mechanisms that mediate physiological responses to the space environment is needed. Entering into microgravity causes  cephalad shift of body  uids which leads to increased heart stroke volume,  rise in left ventricular end diastolic dimensions and   uid shift between the vasculature and interstitium [ ]. The  uid shift invokes compensatory endocrine and renal mechanisms []. These alterations can diminish the capability of the heart to cope with gravitational stress immediately after returning to Earth, leading to orthostatic intolerance, as previously documented in some astronauts []. Gravitational unloading in space also contributes to cardiovascular deconditioning [], despite vigorous on-orbit exercise programs implemented on the International Space Station (ISS). Both space ight and head-down-tilt bed rest,  ground-based model for human space ight, can cause reduced plasma volume and left ventricular atrophy [,10]. reduction in myocardial interstitial  uid may contribute to lower myocardial mass Int. . Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088  of 16 following microgravity exposure [11]. In rodents, 14 days of space ight was reported to reduce cardiac myocyte size relative to ground controls, which is consistent with cardiac atrophy [12]. In contrast, space ight for one week did not affect cardiac mass [13], although it is possible that this period is too short to cause demonstrable cardiac atrophy. Hindlimb unloading (HU),  ground-based rodent model for simulating weightlessness, is reported to cause cardiac atrophy in some studies [14,15], but not in others [13], thus further work in this area is needed. In addition to gravitational unloading, long term habitation in space will expose astronauts to low doses of ionizing radiation, which may contribute to both cardiac and vascular changes in oxidative pathways leading to tissue dysfunction [16 18]. In fact, space ight can cause substantial changes in expression of genes and biomarkers related to metabolic and oxidative stress pathways in various tissues of both astronauts and animals [19 27]. The relative contributions of the various complex factors of habitation in space, including microgravity and ionizing radiation, to observed changes in oxidative stress-related pathways are not yet understood. Activation of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis signal transduction pathways are major stress responses important for defending against many physiological and environmental challenges, including tissue oxidative stress. Space ight can alter expression of various cell cycle arrest and apoptosis regulatory genes [28,29] including CDKN1A (also known as P21),  cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor that mediates cell cycle arrest via cyclin interactions and apoptosis via TRP53. In addition, CDKN1A/P21 is  negative regulator of tissue regeneration in mammals, and is known to interact with NFE2L2 (aka NRF2),  master transcriptional regulator of oxidative defense genes. Space ight elevates Cdkn1a expression in bone tissue [30], liver and kidney [31] as well as cultured cells [29], implicating activation of CDKN1A as  pathway invoked in multiple tissues in response to the space environment. We hypothesized that space ight leads to activation of oxidative stress and cell cycle/apoptosis-related pathways in the heart. To begin to test this hypothesis, we used the- matic PCR arrays to identify the changes in expression levels of genes related to oxidative stress and cell cycle/apoptosis (Trp53) signal transduction pathways in mice exposed to 15 days of space ight on the STS-131 space shuttle mission. Our gene expression  ndings in heart are novel and consistent with activation of several molecular pathways, including those related to oxidative stress, cell cycle regulation, in ammation and DNA damage repair, which ultimately may contribute to cardiac dysfunction during long duration space ight. . Results .. Body Mass of Animals Pre- and Post-Flight Immediately after landing, all  ight (FLT) and ground (GRD) control mice were deter- mined to be in good condition by veterinary examination. Figure  shows the schematic of the experiment design and work ow. The average weight loss of FLT mice over the duration of the experiment was . ( .%, SD = . ,  = .013) whereas GRD control mice lost an average of . ( .%, SD = . ,  = .096); the difference in body weight loss averages for FLT versus GRD was not signi cant ( = .143). FLT habitats showed an average of 10% less food remaining, and 24% less water remaining than GRD habitats. However, measured values for food and water utilization after  ight may not precisely re ect actual consumption by mice due to possible differences in food breakdown and water spillage in FLT versus GRD habitats. .. Space ight Altered Expression of Oxidative Stress Related Genes Comparable quantities (average of 38. RNA per tissue sample) and high qualities of total RNA were obtained from all the FLT and GRD samples. To determine if space ight altered the expression of genes regulating redox balance in cardiac tissue, oxidative stress PCR array was performed on 84 genes related to oxidative metabolism (Supplementary Table S1), and this data set was supplemented with real time PCR analysis of Nfe2l2\n\nInt. .

Gene expression levels of FLT and GRD controls showed  trend towards upregulation of  majority of those genes which were altered by space ight (Table ). Out of the 84 genes on the array, 11 genes were upregulated and  genes were downregulated in FLT samples relative to GRD ( < .05) (Table ). Figure .

The upregulation of Nox1 and downregulation of Ptgs2 may re ect elevated oxidative stress within heart tissue of FLT mice relative to GRD controls.

There were no changes in the expression levels of 12 genes related to oxygen transport (Supplementary Table S1). In contrast, there was  .-fold reduction in expression of the global transcription factor, Nfe2l2, in FLT compared to GRD animals (Figure ). Thus, the expression of redox-related genes was differentially regulated as  consequence of exposure to the space ight environment. Figure .

Space ight Altered Expression of Cell Cycle/Proliferation Related Genes The expression levels of 84 genes involved cell cycle and apoptosis signal transduction were analyzed by p53 Signaling Pathway PCR array (Supplementary Table S2).

Discussion Our  ndings provide new insight into how the heart responds at the molecular level to the novel environment of space. Space ight experiments using rodents present unique practical challenges though similar bene ts to rodent studies on Earth. The animals  own in space during this particular mission were deemed healthy, as assessed by veterinary ex- amination after return to Earth, and the  nding that animal body weights were comparable in FLT mice compared to GRD controls at the termination of the study. Further, numerous scienti  reports from these mice describe related results obtained studying other organ systems (.., [30,32,33]). The RNA samples recovered from the hearts were consistent and of high quality. Therefore, we conclude that the results we obtained from this mission were valid. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088  of 16 Whereas cardiovascular physiology has been studied intensively in astronauts, analysis of cardiac changes at the tissue level has been more limited [12,13,34 36]. Goldstein et al. [12] re- port that space ight (14 days) reduces the cross-sectional area of papillary cardiomyocytes in rats relative to ground controls, with ultrastructural changes consistent with cardiac atrophy. Short duration ( days) space ight upregulates activity and mRNA expression of the mitochondrial enzyme, malate dehydrogenase in rat hearts, and displays  pattern of mitochondrial gene expression changes discrete from those in skeletal muscle [34]. More recently, long duration space ight (37 days) was shown to alter expression of methylation- related genes in the heart of adult mice, but not cytoskeletal protein levels. Interestingly, lifetime exposure of Drosophila to microgravity leads to diminished cardiac size, cardiac dys- function, altered remodeling, and proteosomal abnormalities [36]. Furthermore, space ight causes cardiac progenitor cells in culture to display  gene expression pro le consistent with early, stem-like function along with increased oxidative stress and re-entry into the cell cycle [37]. Thus, our study on expression levels of oxidative stress and cell cycle-related genes provides novel  ndings on how the heart responds to space ight at the tissue level. .. Oxidative Stress-Related Gene Expression in Space ight Heart RT-PCR array data show that expression levels of 14 genes were signi cantly ( < .05) altered (11 upregulated and  downregulated) in FLT samples as compared to GRD controls. In addition, RT-PCR analysis for Nfe2l2 revealed lower levels in FLT mice than GRD. Nfe2l2 is  master transcriptional regulator for oxidative stress response genes, and is rapidly transcribed within seconds following changes in the gravity vector [23]. Other tissues also display reduced Nfe2l2 expression levels in similar space ight experiments entailing tissue recovery after landing [38]. Suzuki et al. recently demonstrated that long duration space ight activates Nfe2l2-dependent oxidative stress pathways in several tissues of growing mice [39]. Furthermore, Nfe2l2-de cient mice are protected from space ight- induced oxidative stress-related genes and changes in body weight [39], and also display accelerated transition of muscle  ber type without protecting from atrophy [40]. We also found that space ight upregulated Nox1 .-fold, the change of greatest magnitude in oxidative stress-related genes observed in our study. NOX1 belongs to the NADPH oxidase family of enzymes and functions in generating ROS in  highly regulated fashion [41,42]. NOX1 utilizes NADPH as an electron donor and catalyzes transfer of electrons to molecular oxygen to generate superoxide radicals. Superoxide radicals are short lived and are readily converted into hydrogen peroxide. Thus, increased expression of Nox1 can cause an increase in the formation of hydrogen peroxide and other reactive oxygen species (ROS) [41,42]. NADPH oxidases are major sources of ROS in the vascular system and are involved in the pathophysiology of many cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and myocardial infarction [43]. Several recent studies using ground-based models to simulate weightlessness show that hindlimb unloading causes cardiac atrophy, reduces cardiomyocyte size and cardiac dysfunction, as assessed by fractional shortening [14]. Inhibition of NOX1 by apocynin ( NADPH oxidase inhibitor) reduces oxidative stress markers in the heart, and mitigates atrophy and dysfunction in hindlimb unloaded mice, suggesting that Nox1 plays an important role in mediating cardiac responses to simulated weightlessness [44]. Thus, our results support the hypothesis that increased expression of Nox1 during space ight contributes to oxidative stress and myocardial abnormalities. Oxidative stress PCR array results showed lower expression of Ptgs2 by .-fold in FLT samples compared to GRD. PTGS2, also known as Cycloxygenase  (COX2), is the key, inducible enzyme in prostaglandin biosynthesis, and acts as both  dioxygenase and as  peroxidase, converting hydrogen peroxide into water. Thus, lower Ptgs2 expression can lead to inef cient removal of hydrogen peroxide, accumulation of ROS and oxidative damage. PTGS2 is important for the maintenance of healthy cardiac tissue. Conditional cardiomyocyte-speci  deletion of the Ptgs2 gene in adult mice reduces cardiac output, decreases exercise tolerance and increases susceptibility to induced ventricular arrhyth-\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088  of 16 mias [45]. Furthermore, human and animal models of myocardial diseases show that Ptgs2 expression is associated with cardiac tissue damaged by infarction, septicemia and in ammatory heart diseases [46]. In addition to in ammation, the prostaglandin pathway plays an important role in mechanical signaling. In cultured cells activated by serum, space-  ight prevents induction of Ptgs2 expression, which is avoided by on-orbit centrifugation to replace the gravity vector, implicating sensitivity to  biomechanical mechanism for microgravity-induced activation of the prostaglandin pathway [47]. Inhibition of PTGS2 also impairs recovery of skeletal muscle and bone from hindlimb unloading [48,49]. Thus, regulation of the prostaglandin pathway by space ight via changes in Ptgs2 expression may contribute to both oxidative stress and subsequent recovery on Earth. Txnip was upregulated .-fold and Fancc was downregulated .-fold in FLT com- pared to GRD, which also may contribute to  pro-oxidative milieu in the heart during space ight. TXNIP is  negative regulator of thioredoxins (TRXs) [50], which are potent antioxidants, and their downregulation by elevated Txnip expression in FLT samples may lead to increased oxidative stress in cardiac tissue. In cultured human endothelial cells (HUVEC), Txnip was the most upregulated by space ight (33-fold) [51]. Fancc codes for an antioxidant and its downregulation can cause sensitivity to oxidative stress-mediated damage to tissue [52]. Our results indicated moderate changes in several antioxidant genes (Sod1, Cat, Prdx6, Gsr, Tpo, Txnrd3, Slc41a3) and other oxidative stress-responsive genes (Xpa, Prnp) (. .-fold,  < .05) (Table ). The observed elevated expression levels of these antioxidant genes may be due to activation of compensatory mechanisms. Although the magnitude of differences between FLT and GRD for statistically signi - cant genes were generally modest, together, the  ndings suggest that space ight activates  network of genes responsible for redox signaling and defense against oxidative stress in the heart. .. Cell Cycle and Senescence-Related Gene Expression in Space ight Heart Increased generation of ROS during space ight can lead to protein, lipid and DNA damage in tissue and, as is the case with skeletal muscle, may contribute to dysfunction caused by gravitational unloading. ROS are also involved in vital cell signaling pathways such as cell-cycle progression, differentiation, in ammation and apoptosis. Cell cycle progression in eukaryotes is regulated at various checkpoints by the action of speci  cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). The activities of these CDKs are controlled by the positive regulation from cyclins and negative regulation from cyclin dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs). Hence, expression levels of genes involved in cell cycle regulation, in ammation, DNA damage repair and apoptosis were further analyzed in hearts by p53 Signaling PCR array. The p53 Signaling PCR array includes 24 genes involved in cell cycle regulation. Results indicate that nine of these genes were signi cantly altered in FLT samples. We found space ight increased Cdkn1a/p21 expression .-fold in hearts compared to GRD, consistent with reports for other tissues including liver, kidney, bone and mus- cle [27,30,31]. CDKN1A (also known as P21), is  potent CDK inhibitor and inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1 phase by inhibiting the activity of CDK2 or CDK4.",

The p53 Signaling PCR array includes 24 genes involved in cell cycle regulation. Results indicate that nine of these genes were signi cantly altered in FLT samples. We found space ight increased Cdkn1a/p21 expression .-fold in hearts compared to GRD, consistent with reports for other tissues including liver, kidney, bone and mus- cle [27,30,31]. CDKN1A (also known as P21), is  potent CDK inhibitor and inhibits cell cycle progression at the G1 phase by inhibiting the activity of CDK2 or CDK4. Increases in p21 levels in bone from mice in this space ight experiment space ight were previously associated with proliferative arrest in cultured osteoprogenitors [30]. However, the adult mammalian heart itself has limited regenerative ability. Adult p21 levels in adult heart are thought to contribute to normal cell cycle arrest in differentiated cardiomyocytes, and there is evidence that cardiomyocytes can divide in the adult human heart [53], though it is unlikely that such  small sub-population (.% of total) [53] can account for our  ndings. More likely, the elevation in p21 caused by space ight may contribute to car- diomyopathies [54] via other cellular processes such as DNA repair, autophagy [38,55,56] and senescence. Interestingly, Myc,  mitogenic transcription factor gene that promotes cardiac hypertrophy in response to Angiotensin II, was also highly upregulated in the space ight heart samples we studied, and its deleterious action can be rescued by p21\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088  of 16 re-expression in p21-null mice [57]. Finally, in newborn mammals, p21 elevation might interfere with cardiomyocyte binucleation, an important heart growth mechanism during post-natal development [58]. PTTG1 (Pituitary tumor-transforming gene ) regulates the cell cycle by inducing cyclin D3 and repressing p21 expression [59]. Thus,  decrease in Pttg1 expression (.-fold) observed in FLT samples may contribute to the observed increase in expression of p21 in FLT samples. In addition to upregulation of cell cycle inhibitors, CDK  and cyclins such as Cdk1 and Cdk4 were downregulated in FLT samples, implicating an overall cell cycle arrest in space ight samples. Our results also indicate some apparently contradictory  ndings, such as the expres- sion levels of genes for cell cycle arrest proteins, Chek2 and Btg2, were decreased .- and .-fold, respectively in FLT samples, contrary to what is expected for Chek2 when Myc is overexpressed based on what is observed in lymphoma cells [60]. Thus, one of the crucial  ndings of our study is that space ight alters the expression levels of major cell cycle and cell growth regulators. As the samples analyzed consist predominantly (but not solely) of fully differentiated non-dividing cardiomyocytes, this suggests that space ight activates p21- and Myc-related pathways to regulate cell growth, cardiomyocyte function, and potentially cardiomyopathy, although complex interactions such as these remain to be elucidated. .. Apoptosis and DNA Damage Repair-Related Gene Expression in Space ight Hearts There were no signi cant changes in apoptosis-related genes such as p53, Bax, Bcl2, Casp2 or Casp9 (Supplementary Table S2). DNA damage repair genes such as Atr, Xrcc5, Ercc1 and Apex1 were only moderately altered in space ight (.- to .-fold), suggesting widespread DNA damage responses were not occurring at the time of sample recovery. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that space ight activates DNA damage and apoptosis pathways in  smaller sub-population of cell types within the heart during space ight, as shown previously for exposure to low dose, heavy ion radiation (16O, 600 MeV/) simulating space radiation [61]. Evidence supporting the possibility that space ight activates DNA damage pathways and/or apoptosis has been reported for tissues other than heart [62], including the thymus [63,64] and the eye [62,64], and multi- omics analyses reveal increased levels of DNA damage markers in urine and blood from astronauts [26]. .. In ammatory Pathway Gene Expression in Space ight Heart In ammatory response genes, such as Tnf (tumor necrosis factor), Tnfrsf10b (Tnf re- ceptor superfamily, member 10) and Traf1 (Tnf receptor-associated factor) were signi cantly downregulated (.-, .- and .-fold decrease) in FLT samples compared to GRD controls. Tnf is  multifunctional pro-in ammatory cytokine, which regulates  wide variety of biological processes such as in ammation, proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and cyto- toxicity [65]. Space is  hazardous environment and proper immune functioning is crucial for astronaut health and success of space missions. The decreased expression of Tnf, Tn- frsf10b and Traf1 observed in our study suggests downregulation of this pro-in ammatory signaling pathway, which may lead to compromised immune function. Our results are consistent with other studies showing space ight reduces Tnf expression levels in both mice [19,66] and humans [67]. In addition, human  cell cultures on the International Space Station (ISS) show  15-fold decrement in expression of Tnf in  cells and its downstream effectors in microgravity as compared to cells centrifuged at 1g [68]. During  very long duration space ight, TNF  expression in the blood of astronauts is elevated [24] but after return to Earth (between days  and ) as skeletal muscle enters  recovery phase, Tnf  expression rapidly declines along with other cytokines in the Il6 pathway [69]. Together, these  ndings implicate  biomechanical, gravity-dependent mechanism for regulating Tnf-related pathways. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088 10 of 16 Although the radiation exposure of mice on the STS-131 mission is considered too low to account for our results, relatively low doses of particle radiation (<30 cGy) can lead to altered regulation of disease-related pathways and de cits in cardiac function [70,71]. Furthermore, expression of oxidative stress and in ammation markers in the heart caused by low dose gamma radiation exposure is exacerbated when combined with hindlimb unloading [17]. Further study is needed to determine the in uence of space radiation in combination with microgravity, on the heart in the space ight environment during long duration missions. .. Gene Networks and Molecular Signatures of Disease Computational analysis revealed that changes in  subset of genes that were differen- tially expressed due to space ight were linked to disease, including immune suppression and impairments in glucose homeostasis, consistent with  ndings in astronauts [72,73]. In addition,  subset of the DEGs resulting from space ight were associated with cardio- vascular pathologies such as atherosclerosis, cardiovascular decompensation, hyperten- sive disease and myocardial infarction. Cardiovascular decompensation and volumetric changes in blood  ow were consistent with previous observations in crew members dur- ing  ight [,,74]. In  previous study on  subset of ISS crewmembers, mean arterial pressures reportedly do not change signi cantly during space ight. However, cardiac output and stroke volume are increased in  ight compared to the seated position on Earth (although comparable to the supine position on Earth) []. Thus, our  ndings were con- sistent with previous reports on astronauts indicating that space ight adversely affects cardiovascular health. Computational analyses also indicated that space ight led to altered regulation of molecular networks within the oxidative damage response and cell proliferation path- ways. Our  ndings suggest that oxidative stress and Trp35 signaling pathways were linked and that space ight alters gene interactions between these two pathways. Furthermore, transcription factors FoxO3, Jun, Myc, and Hif1a were predicted to mediate the interaction between these two pathways, making these genes promising targets for mitigating gene network changes in response to space ight. Cat, Cdkn1a, Cdk1 and Cdk4 also were pre- dicted to serve as central hubs of gene networks that are altered by space ight. Hence, these molecules may be potential targets for the development of countermeasures against space ight-induced tissue de cits. .. Limitations For extrapolation of  ndings from this murine study to humans, there is the inherent limitation of the difference in species as well as  potential in uence of the speci  strain and sex which were selected as subjects. Factors related to experimental protocol also important to consider when interpreting gene expression  ndings from this experiment include the  xed duration of the mission (15 days), sample recovery only after animals were returned to Earth (+ hours after landing), and the fact that ground control animals were housed in  ight-matched habitats but were not exposed to similar forces as the  ight mice encountered during launch and landing. Therefore, observed changes in gene expression did not solely re ect changes observed during habitation in microgravity, but for rapidly responding genes, such as Nfe2l2, also may re ect re-entry and re-adaptation to -gravity on Earth, however brie . As the scope of our investigation focused on RT-PCR, additional studies are needed to elucidate how space ight-induced oxidative stress may mediate cell cycle/growth and function, to gain deeper insight into how the cardiovascular system responds to the space environment and recovers after return to Earth. Furthermore, because the heart consists of multiple cell types, including cardiomyocytes,  broblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages, each with  discrete gene expression pro le [53], future experiments could focus on spatial transcriptomics to determine the cellular source of speci  gene expression changes, as well as the regulation of protein expression together with cardiac function.

Ethics Statement All animal procedures were conducted in accordance with guidelines described by the National Institute of Health Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and approved by all relevant committees, including the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Ames Research Center. The IACUC approval number associated with this animal study was NAS-10-002-Y1. .. Animals and Space ight The mice in this study were  own on the Space Shuttle Discovery during the STS-131 mission for the experiment  Mouse Antigen-Speci  CD4+  Cell Priming and Memory Response during Space ight . The heart tissue used in this experiment was an award to . Almeida as part of the NASA STS-131 Mouse Immunology  Biospecimen Sharing Program (BSP). Female C57BL/6J mice were acclimatized to space ight food bars and lixits, but were not placed in Animal Enclosure Module (AEM) habitats until just before space ight. Mice were divided into two groups:  ight (FLT) and ground (GRD) control. The NASA AEM units are composed of  stainless-steel grid cage, fan blowers,  layered  lter system, interior lamps, specialized food bars, and  water box. The AEM units are self-contained habitats that provide group housing with constant ad libitum access to food and water while also providing  waste management system that isolates the animals from their waste. FLT mice were launched at 14 weeks of age then  own in space for 15 days and were not subjected to any experimental procedures during space ight. Synchronous GRD control mice were also housed in AEMs, maintained in an orbital environmental simulator at Kennedy Space Center, and exposed to environmental condi- tions matched closely to those of FLT mice on the shuttle (temperature, light/dark cycle, humidity, and carbon dioxide levels). FLT and GRD control animals were weighed before  ight and immediately after return and were subjected to veterinary examination prior to euthanasia. Food and water consumption of each group were measured upon recovery. Animals were euthanized at 16 weeks of age starting approximately   after landing using iso urane anesthesia followed by thoracotomy. Euthanasia and dissections proceeded at  pace of one mouse every 15 20 min. The heart was removed and major veins and feed arteries trimmed off. The hearts of four mice per group were bisected into the cephalic and caudal regions, and the caudal halves (ventricles) were frozen in liquid nitrogen for later analysis of gene expression (the remaining hearts from four mice per group were distributed to another BSP investigator).",

The hearts of four mice per group were bisected into the cephalic and caudal regions, and the caudal halves (ventricles) were frozen in liquid nitrogen for later analysis of gene expression (the remaining hearts from four mice per group were distributed to another BSP investigator). The frozen samples were transported on dry ice to NASA Ames Research Center and stored in liquid nitrogen until analysis. .. RNA Isolation and cDNA Synthesis Total RNA was isolated from frozen heart tissue by homogenization and RNA extrac- tion using TRIzol reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Tissue samples were homogenized in  mL of TRIzol reagent and incubated at room temperature for  min. After incubation, . mL of chloroform was added, the sample agitated vigorously for 30  and then incubated for  min at room temperature. The mixture was then centrifuged at 12,000   for 15 min at   . Following centrifugation, the upper aqueous phases were separated and incubated with . mL of isopropanol for 10 min at room temperature. Sam- ples were then centrifuged at 12,000   for 15 min at    and the RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 100   of nuclease-free water and further puri ed using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA), per instructions. The quantities and qualities of puri ed RNA were determined by measuring absorbance at 260 nm and 280 nm using  NanoDrop 2000 Spectrophotometer (Thermo Scienti , Wilmington, DE, USA). RNA integrity was assessed by running RNA on .% agarose formaldehyde-denaturing gel with ethidium bromide and further visualized by Fluor- Multimager (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Int. . Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088 12 of 16 All RNA samples were analyzed by thematic real time PCR arrays (for Oxidative Stress and p53-related pathways) or RT-PCR (for Nfe2l2). Although whole transcriptome analysis would be valuable, samples are no longer available for additional analyses. .. Quantitative Real-Time PCR Array An equal amount of RNA (  ) was used from FLT and GRD samples to synthe- size cDNA using RT2 PCR Array First Strand Kit (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA). Real-time PCR was performed using the Oxidative Stress PCR Array (PAMM-065) and p53 Signaling Pathway PCR Array (PAMM-027) according to the manufacturer  protocol (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA). Brie , FLT and GRD cDNA samples were mixed with RT2 SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, USA) and dis- tributed across the 96-well plate array. Each of the 96-well plate arrays contained primers for 84 genes related to oxidative stress or p53 signaling pathways and control housekeep- ing genes (HKG). PCR was performed in  thermal cycler (ABI 7500 Standard, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) with initial denaturation at 95   for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95   for 15  and 60   for one minute. FLT and GRD cDNA samples were also run on control RT2 RNA QC PCR Array plates (PAMM-999) to test RNA quality, reverse transcription ef ciency, PCR ef ciency and genomic DNA contamination. .. Nfe2l2 Real-Time PCR cDNA was synthesized by using QuantiTect Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen, Va- lencia, CA, USA). Brie ,    of RNA sample was treated with gDNA Wipeout Buffer at 42   for  min then reverse-transcription was performed using Quantiscript RT Buffer and Quantiscript Reverse Transcriptase as per manufacturer  instruction. The Real-Time PCR mixture was made using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA). Synthesized cDNA from the previous step was mixed with Quantiscript SYBR Green PCR Mix and Nfe2l2 primer mixture, per manufacturer  protocol. Real-time PCR was performed in  thermal cycler (ABI 7500 Standard, Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) with initial activation at 95   for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95   for 15  and 60   for  min. Ct values were retrieved by maintaining the same threshold among all the samples. .. Data Analysis and Statistics For the Oxidative Stress PCR Array (PAMM-065) and p53 Signaling Pathway PCR Array, relative expression levels of genes were calculated using the comparative threshold cycle method ( Ct) with normalization to the average expression levels of  ve house- keeping genes (SABiosciences Data Analysis Software). FLT samples were compared to GRD controls using Mann Whitney  Test using  < .05 as the threshold of signi cance and sample size of  =  mice per group. For Nfe2l2 RT-PCR of heart samples, the change in expression levels were calculated using the  Ct method with Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase (Hprt)  as house- keeping gene. The log2 (linear) normalized expression from  ight and ground control groups was used in the Mann Whitney  test at  < .05,  =  mice per group. .. Gene Network Predictions and Functional Analysis To generate predictions on potential protein interactions, statistically signi cant differ- entially expressed genes from both PCR arrays were entered into the String DB protein- protein interaction database [75]. Experimental evidence, databases, and co-expression were used as sources to generate protein interaction networks. The interaction score was set to  threshold of  medium  (.400). Toppfun [76] was used to gain insight into whether the differentially expressed genes were linked to human disease phenotypes. Statistically signi cant differentially expressed genes were entered into the Toppfun database. The results were  ltered using  Benjamini\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2021, 22, 9088 13 of 16 Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) threshold of  < .05 and  query to genome overlap of four or more genes. . Conclusions In conclusion, our study revealed that space ight signi cantly altered cardiac expres- sion of genes related to cell cycle/growth (notably Cdkn1a/p21, Cdk1, and Myc), in amma- tion (notably Tnf) and oxidative stress (notably Nfe2l2, Nox1, Ptgs2), which may contribute to cardiac dysfunction. These  ndings provide novel data suitable for developing testable hypotheses for further study. Identi cation of speci  mechanisms and molecules responsi- ble for excess ROS generation during space ight is of considerable interest, and may yield new therapeutic approaches.

These structures attain their tubu- lar shapes by con ning growth to the cell apex,  process called tip growth. The actin cytoskeleton and endomembrane systems are essential for tip growth; however, little is known about how these cellular components coordinate their activities during this process. Here, we show that SPIRRIG (SPI),  beige and Chediak Higashi domain-containing protein involved in membrane traf cking, and BRK1 and SCAR2, subunits of the WAVE/SCAR (/SC) actin nucleating promoting complex, display polarized localizations in Arabidopsis thaliana root hairs during distinct developmental stages. SPI accumulates at the root hair apex via post-Golgi compart- ments and positively regulates tip growth by maintaining tip-focused vesicle secretion and  lamentous-actin integrity. BRK1 and SCAR2 on the other hand, mark the root hair initiation domain to specify the position of root hair emergence. Consistent with the lo- calization data, tip growth was reduced in spi and the position of root hair emergence was disrupted in brk1 and scar1234. BRK1 de- pletion coincided with SPI accumulation as root hairs transitioned from initiation to tip growth. Taken together, our work uncovers  role for SPI in facilitating actin-dependent root hair development in Arabidopsis through pathways that might intersect with /SC. Introduction Root hairs are single-cell tubular projections that emerge from root epidermal cells. Root hairs increase the effective surface area of the root system by extending laterally into soil pores, thus enabling increased access to nutrients and water (Carminati et al., 2017; Ruiz et al., 2020). Root hairs have been studied extensively by plant biologists for decades Breakthrough Report Accepted April 15, 2021. Advance access publication April 20, 2021   The Author() 2021.

Open Access doi:10.1093/plcell/koab115 THE PLANT CELL 2021: 33: 2131\n\nbecause they serve as excellent models to unravel mecha- nisms by which cell size and shape in plants are regulated (Grierson et al., 2014). To attain their cylindrical shapes, root hairs undergo tip growth,  process in which expansion of the cell is confined to its apical domain. Tip growth involves  balance between the directed delivery of post-Golgi com- partments carrying protein complexes and cell wall building blocks to the cell apex and localized cell wall loosening and recycling of excess membranes. Besides root hairs, tip growth is exhibited by other cell types such as pollen tubes, fungal hyphae, and rhizoids of mosses, liverworts, and algae (Bascom et al., 2018a). Root epidermal cells called trichoblasts are the cell types that form root hairs. Work in Arabidopsis thaliana has shown that trichoblasts are specified to become root hair- forming cells early during root development through the patterned assembly of protein complexes of transcriptional activators and repressors in different cell files (Schiefelbein et al., 2014; Shibata et al., 2018). Upon establishing their identity, trichoblasts undergo two developmental stages that lead to root hair outgrowth. The first stage is the establish- ment of  root hair initiation domain (RHID) that eventually leads to  conspicuous root hair bulge at the basal (root-tip oriented) end of the trichoblast (Grierson et al., 2014; Nakamura and Grebe, 2018). Several proteins accumulate at the RHID, most prominently, the Rho of Plants (ROP) small GTPases and their guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activators (Denninger et al., 2019). The second stage is tip growth. In addition to small GTPases, the cytoskeleton, the endomembrane trafficking machinery, cytoplasmic calcium, phosphoinositide lipids, hormones (.. auxin and ethylene), and reactive oxygen species are other major players in sig- naling pathways that modulate root hair development (Bascom et al., 2018a; Nakamura and Grebe, 2018). The filamentous-actin (-actin) and microtubule cytoskele- tons orchestrate root hair development. The actin cytoskele- ton in particular has been studied widely during tip growth, as it functions as tracks for the trafficking of cellular cargo to the cell apex (Stephan, 2017; Bascom et al., 2018a; Szymanski and Staiger, 2018). Many insights into the role of the actin cytoskeleton in tip growth have been demon- strated through work with Arabidopsis mutants and phar- macological approaches involving the use of chemicals that disrupt -actin. For example, the actin-disrupting compound latrunculin  (LatB) inhibits tip growth, while also inducing the formation of root hairs and pollen tubes with irregular shapes (Bibikova et al., 1999; Gibbon et al., 1999). In this re- gard, Arabidopsis mutants with defects in the root hair- expressed vegetative ACTIN2 (ACT2) gene are characterized by root hairs that mirror those treated with LatB (Ringli et al., 2002; Yoo et al., 2012). Furthermore, ACT2 and ACT7 mutants display an apical (shoot-ward) shift in the position of the RHID compared to the wild-type (Kiefer et al., 2015). To fulfill its cellular functions, the actin cytoskeleton is or- ganized into higher order networks that correspond to the growth strategy of the cell. This is evident in tip-growing cells, whereby the base and shank of the cell consist mostly of thick, longitudinal -actin bundles, while the apex con- tains actin fringes, rings, patches, or  fine meshwork, depending on the plant species or cell type (Stephan, 2017). 2132 | THE PLANT CELL 2021: 33: 2131 2148 . Chin et al. To sustain tip growth, the integrity and organization of these tip-focused -actin arrays must be maintained,  task facilitated by  diverse collection of actin-binding proteins and actin nucleators (Li et al., 2015; Paez-Garcia, 2018; Szymanski and Staiger, 2018). The actin-related protein (ARP2/) complex and its activa- tor, suppressor of cAMP receptor (SCAR)-WASP family ver- prolin homologous (WAVE) complex (/SC), is one of the most well-characterized actin nucleators in plants (Deeks and Hussey, 2005; Szymanski, 2005; Yanagisawa et al., 2013). Upon conversion from an inactive open conformation to an active closed conformation, the ARP2/ complex promotes -actin nucleation from the sides of existing filaments by forming  surface that mimics stable actin dimers (Blanchoin et al., 2000; Robinson et al., 2001; Rodal et al., 2005). Activation of ARP2/ for efficient nucleation of -ac- tin requires the /SC nucleation promoting factor (NPF) complex. In addition to /SC, the NPF consists of the pro- teins SRA1, NAP1, ABI1, and HSPC300/BRICK1 (BRK1) (Basu et al., 2004, 2005; El-Assal et al., 2004; Djakovic et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2005b, 2008; Jo rgens et al., 2010). Studies of Arabidopsis trichome development have been most instru- mental in revealing insights into the function of /SC- ARP2/ in plants. Plant counterparts to the mammalian / SC-ARP2/ subunits were first uncovered through the clon- ing of disrupted genes in  set of DISTORTED (DIS) Arabidopsis trichome mutants (Hu lskamp et al., 1994; Le et al., 2003; Mathur et al., 2003; Basu et al., 2004; Deeks et al., 2004; El-Assal Sel et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2005a). / SC is the only known NPF for ARP2/, and BRK1 and SCAR mutants display null arp2/ trichome phenotypes (Le et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008). In addition to trichome development, the /SC-ARP2/ actin filament-nucleating module has been implicated in specifying leaf pavement cell shape, light and auxin-depen- dent root growth, stomatal gating, gravitropism, responses to salinity stress, and plant immunity (Li et al., 2003; Basu et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2005a; Dyachok et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014; Zou et al., 2016; Isner et al., 2017; Pratap Sahi et al., 2018; Badet et al., 2019). The /SC and ARP2/ complexes have been shown to play essential roles in some tip growing cells, such as the protonemal cells of the moss Physcomitrium (formerly Physcomitrella) patens. This was shown when RNA interference of transcripts encoding selected subunits of the moss /SC and ARP2/ complexes resulted in substantial protonemal tip growth defects (Harries et al., 2005; Perroud and Quatrano, 2006; Finka et al., 2008). The importance of the /SC andARP2/ complexes was further demonstrated by Perroud and Quatrano (2006, 2008), who showed that two of its compo- nents, BRK1 and ARPC4, accumulated in tips of moss proto- nemal cells. In contrast, Arabidopsis plants with mutations in components of the /SC and ARP2/ complexes dis- played minimal or no defects in root hair or pollen tube growth (Li et al., 2003; Mathur et al., 2003), and none of the subunits have been conclusively shown to exhibit clear polar localization in these cell types. Therefore, the extent by which the /SC and ARP2/ complexes function in tip growing cells of plants remains to be determined. SPIRRIG (SPI) is one of eight genes that has been consid- ered to be  member of the DIS group, but compared to other DIS mutants, the trichome phenotypes of spi are less severe and the mutant does not display early stage cell swelling that is diagnostic of the DIS group (Schwab et al., 2003). SPI was shown to encode  ,571 amino acid long protein with -terminally located armadillo and concanava- lin -like lectin domains and -terminally located pleckstrin homology, beige and Chediak Higashi (BEACH), and WD40 repeat domains (Saedler et al., 2009). BEACH domain-con- taining proteins are highly conserved in eukaryotes and are known to function in membrane dynamics, vesicle trans- port, apoptosis, and receptor signaling. This family of pro- teins is of clinical importance as they have been implicated in  variety of human disorders, such as cancer, autoimmu- nity syndrome, and autism (Cullinane et al., 2013). In addition to mild trichome defects, Arabidopsis SPI mutants have short root hairs characterized by fragmented vacuoles, suggesting that SPI, like other eukaryotic BEACH domain-containing proteins, functions in membrane traffick- ing (Saedler et al., 2009). Additionally, Steffens et al. (2017) showed that SPI physically interacts with proteins involved in endosomal sorting, reinforcing its role in membrane remodeling. SPI was also demonstrated to localize to mRNA processing bodies (-bodies) in transiently transfected Arabidopsis epidermal cells, thereby suggesting  novel role for SPI in post-transcriptional regulation (Steffens et al., 2015). Because SPI had  substantial but incomplete overlap with distorted mutant phenotypes, it was suggested that SPI might be involved in actin-mediated cell developmental pro- cesses (Saedler et al., 2009), and perhaps function in coordi- nation with /SC and ARP2/ complexes. However, SPI is not  known /SC or ARP2/ subunit; therefore, its rela- tionship to ARP2/ function is unclear. Moreover, the uncer- tainty with regard to SPI function is confounded by the fact that its subcellular localization in root hairs, which exhibit the most profound phenotype when SPI is mutated, remains unknown.",

Moreover, the uncer- tainty with regard to SPI function is confounded by the fact that its subcellular localization in root hairs, which exhibit the most profound phenotype when SPI is mutated, remains unknown. In the current study, we addressed these questions by generating  fully functional SPI fluorescent protein fusion and documented its spatial and temporal localization during root hair development. In addition, we used live cell micros- copy to simultaneously image the dynamics of SPI and / SC and correlate SPI localization with root hair tip-focused -actin. Taken together, our results point to potential func- tional relationships among SPI, /SC, and actin during root hair development. Results Isolation of  new SPIRRIG mutant allele We previously described  forward genetic screen that led to the isolation of three nonallelic recessive Arabidopsis mutants that were hypersensitive to the growth inhibitory The Plant Cell, 2021 Vol. 33, No. THE PLANT CELL 2021: 33: 2131 2148 |\n\neffects of LatB. The hypersensitive to LatB1 (hlb1) and hlb3 mutants have been described previously (Sparks et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2019). hlb1 was disrupted in  gene encoding  trans-Golgi network-localized tetratricopeptide repeat pro- tein involved in actin-mediated membrane recycling (Sparks et al., 2016), whereas the genetic lesion in hlb3 was found to encode the class II actin nucleator formin (Sun et al., 2019). Here, we report on hlb2, the third of these recessive mutants. Like hlb1 and hlb3, primary root growth was more severely inhibited by LatB in hlb2 compared to the wild- type. In the absence of LatB or at low (.. 25 nM) LatB con- centrations, the primary root length of hlb2 was similar to the wild-type. Differences in root length between wild-type and hlb2 became apparent when seedlings were grown on  concentration of 50-nM LatB and higher (Supplemental Figure S1,  ). Through map-based cloning, we found that the mutation in hlb2 was confined to  region between the AT1G02740 and AT1G03410 loci. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that hlb2 had  10-base pair deletion (Chr1 position: 720,152  720,161) in exon 14 of the AT1G03060 gene. This 10-base pair deletion led to an open-reading frame shift at the Asp1526 codon, resulting in  truncated protein (Supplemental Figure S2A). AT1G03060 encodes the BEACH domain-containing protein SPI (Saedler et al., 2009; Supplemental Figure S2A). Because the first spi mutant alleles were reported to have short root hairs (Saedler et al., 2009), we examined root hairs of hlb2. The growth rate of hlb2 root hairs was approximately 70% slower than the wild-type, with some root hairs forming only small bulges (Supplemental Figure S2,  and ). Moreover, hlb2 had mild trichome defects that were reminiscent of the phenotypes of previously isolated spi mutant alleles (Supplemental Figure S2D; Saedler et al., 2009). To further verify if HLB2 is SPI, we obtained  mutant from the publicly available SALK collection (SALK_065311), which had  -DNA insertion in the 10th exon of the SPI gene (Supplemental Figure S2A; Alonso et al., 2003). The SALK_065311 line we obtained is the same as the spi- mutant allele reported previously in Steffens et al. (2015). In addition to having similar root hair and trichome defects to hlb2, primary roots of spi- were hypersensitive to LatB (Supplemental Figure S2E), and  cross between hlb2 and SALK_065311 failed to complement each other in the F1 hybrid. Taken together, these results in- dicate that hlb2 is  new spi mutant allele. Based on earlier nomenclature (Steffens et al., 2015), we renamed hlb2 as spi-  (Supplemental Figure S2A). The spi- mutant allele was used for all subsequent experiments. SPIRRIG localizes to the tips of rapidly elongating root hairs SPI fluorescent protein fusions were previously demon- strated to associate with -bodies and endosomes (Steffens et al., 2015, 2017). However, these constructs have not been shown to complement the defective root hair and trichome phenotypes of spi. Due to the large size of SPI, we were unable to generate native promoter-driven fluorescent pro- tein fusions to the full-length SPI complementary DNA or genomic DNA. To overcome this problem, SPI was tagged with the 3x-Yellow Fluorescent Protein (YFP) for energy transfer (YPet; Nguyen and Daugherty, 2005) using  method called recombineering. This method involves tagging the gene of interest in the context of transformation-com- petent bacterial artificial chromosomes to ensure that all regulatory sequences are included in the fluorescent protein fusion (Zhou et al., 2011; Brumos et al., 2020). Once spi was transformed with  recombineered SPI-YPet construct, primary root hypersensitivity to LatB, short root hairs, and defective trichome phenotypes were rescued, indi- cating that the construct was functional (Figure 1A; Supplemental Figure S3). Transgenic complementation of spi with SPI-YPet provided additional evidence that HLB2 is SPI. Confocal microscopy of more than 150 root hairs from at least 25 seedlings revealed that SPI-YPet signal was strongest in the tips of rapidly elongating root hairs (Figure ,  and ; (Supplemental Movies S1 and S2). Low magnification time-lapse movies showed that 100% of rapidly elongating root hairs had robust SPI-YPet signal at the tips (Supplemental Movie S1). Weak or no SPI-YPet fluorescence was detected at the RHID and during early root hair bulge formation, but the signal intensified as the root hairs transi- tioned to tip growth (Figure 1C; Supplemental Movie S3). SPI-YPet signal dissipated as the root hairs matured and the tip growth rate declined (Figure ,  and ; Supplemental Movie S4). linear regression analysis showed that the in- tensity of SPI-YPet fluorescence in root hair tips is signifi- cantly positively correlated to rapid root hair growth (Figure 1D). These results indicate that the SPI protein has functions related to root hair elongation, which is consistent with the short root hair phenotypes of spi. SPIRRIG is transported to the root hair tip via post- Golgi compartments The prominent SPI-YPet signal at the tips of elongating root hairs is reminiscent of the localization patterns of post-Golgi markers such as RAB small GTPases, which are known to function in tip-directed secretion (Preuss et al., 2004). We therefore hypothesized that SPI is trafficked to the tips of root hairs via post-Golgi compartments. To test this hypoth- esis, we treated seedlings expressing SPI-YPet with Brefeldin  (BFA). BFA is  fungal toxin that is routinely used to in- vestigate endomembrane dynamics because it prevents vesi- cle formation for exocytosis by inhibiting ADP ribosylation factor GEFs (ARF-GEFs), while still enabling endocytosis and some retrograde pathways to continue (Balu\u0002ska, 2002, Doyle et al., 2015). In Arabidopsis roots, BFA binds to the ARF-GEF GNOM, which is localized to early endosomes in the endo- cytic pathway, and possibly also in the trans-Golgi network (TGN; Robinson et al., 2008). Consequently, BFA treatment in Arabidopsis roots causes the formation of TGN/endoso- mal agglomerations called BFA-induced compartments. Treatment of seedlings expressing SPI-YPet with 50-mM BFA 2134 | THE PLANT CELL 2021: 33: 2131 2148 . Chin et al. induced the formation of SPI-YPet agglomerates in root hairs (Figure ,  ). The average number of BFA-induced compartments per root hair was .696 .05 (SD). We also quantified the effect of BFA by obtaining the fluorescence ratio of the SPI-YPet agglomerates to the fluorescence of the root hair cytoplasm that did not contain any agglomerates (Figure 2D, inset). The higher fluorescence ratio of BFA- treated root hairs compared to untreated controls reinforces our qualitative observations of the sensitivity of SPI-YPet to BFA (Figure 2D). The appearance of fluorescent puncta at the shank of root hairs also suggests that SPI-YPet is traf- ficked to the tip via post-Golgi compartments (Supplemental Movies S2 S4). These results indicate that SPI-YPet is associated with endomembranes and is trafficked to the root hair tips via BFA-sensitive post-Golgi compartments. The slow root hair growth of spi and the formation of SPI-YPet agglomerates after BFA treatment suggest that spi may be defective in tip-directed protein secretion, which would partly explain the short root hair phenotypes of spi. To address this question, we expressed the secreted (SEC)- red fluorescent protein (RFP), which contains  cleavable sporamin signal peptide that accumulates in the apoplast (Faso et al., 2009), and observed changes in endocytosis Figure   functional SPI-YPet fusion localizes to the tips of growing root hairs. , SPI-YPet rescues the short root hair phenotype of spi.

Similar to previous reports, rapidly elongating wild-type root hairs had  tip-focused gradient of SEC-RFP (Sparks et al., 2016; Figure 2E). In contrast, slow- growing root hairs of spi lacked these tip-focused SEC-RFP gradients (Figure 2E). We quantified tip-focused SEC-RFP in elongating wild-type and spi root hairs by obtaining the ra- tio of tip fluorescence to the subapical cytoplasm (Figure 2F, inset). The lower fluorescence ratio of spi root hairs com- pared to the wild-type confirmed our qualitative observa- tions (Figure 2F). These results were corroborated by examining FM -43 dye uptake. spi root hairs showed  sig- nificantly reduced tip-focused FM -43 gradient compared to the wild-type (Supplemental Figure S4,  ). Altogether, the loss of tip-focused secretion indicated that the spi mutants had defects in tip-directed bulk flow exocytosis. SPIRRIG maintains root hair tip-focused -actin In  study of other spi mutant alleles, the similarities in phe- notypes among spi, /sc, and arp2/ mutants suggested that SPI could function in actin-dependent cellular processes (Saedler et al., 2009). However, because the trichome defects of spi were mild compared to other /sc and arp2/ mutants, no obvious actin phenotypes were observed in spi trichomes (Schwab et al., 2003). To clarify the relationship between SPI and actin, we focused on investigating actin or- ganization in root hairs, since these structures displayed the most obvious growth defects in SPI-altered plants. To study actin organization, we expressed the live -actin reporter UBQ10: mGFP-Lifeact in spi (Vidali et al., 2010).",

In spi root hairs, the distinct -actin meshwork observed in wild- type root hairs was unable to form.

In the small population of spi root hairs that were able to undergo tip growth,  few exhibited  tip- focused -actin meshwork that resembled those observed in elongating wild-type root hairs (Figure 3K). However, most of these slow-growing spi root hairs lacked  tip-focused - actin meshwork (Figure ,  and ; Supplemental Movie S5) or had thick -actin bundles protruding to the tip,  feature that was reminiscent of nongrowing, mature wild-type root hairs (Figure 3N). We quantified the disruption of the tip-fo- cused -actin meshwork in spi by measuring -actin fluores- cence from computer-reconstructed transverse sections of the root hair tip and by taking the ratio of the average fluo- rescence over background signal. higher ratio indicates  higher signal of tip-focused -actin (Figure 3O). Our analysis showed that the fluorescence ratio in spi root hairs was sig- nificantly reduced compared to the wild-type root hairs, supporting visual observations that the tip-focused -actin meshwork in spi root hairs is disrupted (Figure 3P). To ensure that the mGFP-Lifectact probe did not interfere with normal root hair elongation or -actin organization, we compared the growth rates of the wild-type and spi with and without the reporter. The root hair growth rates of wild-type root hairs without the mGFP-Lifeact probe were not significantly different from that of wild-type root hairs expressing the reporter. Similarly, the growth rate of spi expressing mGFP-Lifectact was not significantly different from that of spi without the reporter (Figure 3Q). We generated plants expressing both SPI-YPet and mRuby-Lifeact to examine the correlation between SPI and -actin in growing root hairs. In elongating root hairs of dual labeled seedlings, SPI-YPet and the mRuby-labeled -actin meshwork overlapped at the tips of actively elongating root hairs (Figure 4A; Supplemental Movie S6). In one time-lapse sequence, when the root hair stopped growing at the 80  120 min time points, both SPI-YPet and mRuby-labeled -ac- tin meshwork dissipated from the root tip (Figure 4A). Quantification of both SPI-YPet and mRuby-Lifeact from at least three root hair time-lapse sequences revealed that the appearances of both markers at the tip were highly corre- lated to each other (Figure ,  and ). This supports the notion that root hair tip-localized SPI is strongly associated with the tip-focused -actin meshwork, and as such is in- volved in sustaining normal root hair elongation in coordi- nation with actin. BRK1 and SCAR2 are molecular determinants of the root hair initiation domain The identification of SPI as one of the genes in the DIS group that also included genes encoding subunits of the / SC and ARP2/ complexes (Saedler et al., 2009) raises the possibility that SPI might function in root hair developmen- tal pathways mediated by /SC-ARP2/. Furthermore, the observation that SPI-YPET accumulation at the root hair tip (Figure ) mirrors the enrichment of BRK1-YFP and ARPC4- GFP at the apex of Physcomitrium protonemal cells (Perroud and Quatrano, 2006, 2008) raises the possibility that the /SC and ARP2/ complexes are localized to the root hair. In an attempt to link SPI with the /SC and ARP2/ pathways, we imaged roots of brk1 complemented with BRK1promoter:BRK1-YFP (hereafter referred to as BRK1- YFP; Figure ,  ; Dyachok et al., 2008). Unlike SPI-YPet, we did not observe  BRK1-YFP fluorescence gradient in rap- idly elongating root hairs. However, closer examination of trichoblasts revealed prominent BRK1-YFP signal at the plasma membrane of the RHID that mirrored the localiza- tion of other known early root hair initiation site markers such as ROP (Figure 5A). Unlike ROP, which has  persistent plasma membrane localization throughout root hair devel- opment (Molendijk et al., 2001; Jones et al., 2002), BRK1-YFP signal was transient and dissipated as root hairs transitioned to rapid tip growth (Figure 5B; Supplemental Movie S7). This observation was in contrast to the intensification of SPI-YPet fluorescence as root hairs proceeded with rapid tip growth (see Figure ). In agreement with our visual observa- tions,  linear regression analysis showed that BRK1-YFP fluorescence is inversely proportional to the root hair growth rate (Figure 5C). Given that BRK1 stabilizes the entire family of SCAR pro- teins and is required for functional /SC assembly (Le et al., 2006), we investigated if the SCAR protein localized to the RHID, as did BRK1. To address this question, we imaged  recombineered SCAR2-mCherry fusion expressed in the scar1 scar2 scar3 scar4 (scar1234) quadruple mutant back- ground. Like BRK1-YFP, SCAR2-mCherry marked the RHID and dissipated when rapid root hair tip growth commenced (Figure 5D). The accumulation of BRK1-YFP and SCAR2-mCherry at the RHID led us to hypothesize that brk1 and scar1234 might have defects in root hair initiation. One parameter that has been studied extensively as an indicator of root hair initiation defects is planar polarity, which is  measure of root hair po- sition along the length of the trichoblast (Nakamura and Grebe, 2018). We found that the root hair positions of brk1 and scar1234 shifted apically (.. toward the shoot) com- pared to the wild-type (Figure 5F).",

We found that the root hair positions of brk1 and scar1234 shifted apically (.. toward the shoot) com- pared to the wild-type (Figure 5F). The planar polarity defects of brk1 were rescued by expressing BRK1-YFP in brk1, while partial complementation of scar1234 was achieved by expressing SCAR2-mCherry in scar1234 (Figure 5F). We also investigated if the ARP2/ pathway was involved in RHID, since the /SC complex can interact with the ARP2/ pathway. APR2/ subunit mutants arp2, arp3, and arpc5 exhibited significantly apically shifted root hairs that were similar to those of brk1 and scar1234 (Figure 5F). Nonetheless, we did not observe polarized accumulation of ARPC5-GFP at the RHID or at root hair tips (Supplemental Figure S5). These results suggest that the ARP2/ pathway may interact with the /SC complex at the RHID but is not essential for root hair positioning. Taken together, our results reveal that BRK1 and SCAR2 are molecular determinants of the RHID that are required for specifying the position of root hair emergence and can 2138 | THE PLANT CELL 2021: 33: 2131 2148 . Chin et al. do so in both an ARP2/-dependent and -independent manner. SPI is required for the depletion of BRK1 as root hairs transition to tip growth Live cell microscopy of BRK1-YFP and SPI-YPet revealed con- trasting spatial and temporal dynamics, with the former in- tensifying and the latter dissipating as root hairs elongated (Figures  and ). To observe BRK1 and SPI simultaneously within the same root hair, we generated plants expressing both SPI-YPet and BRK1-mRuby3. Similar to BRK1-YFP, BRK1-mRuby3 labeled the RHID and dissipated as the root hair bulge expanded (Figure 6A). Within the same root hair cell, SPI-YPet fluorescence at the tip intensified as BRK1- mRuby3 dissipated (Figure 6A; Supplemental Movie S8). To better understand the relationship between SPI and BRK1, we expressed BRK1-YFP in spi and SPI-YPet in brk1. Unlike BRK1-YFP in the complemented brk1 background (Figure 5B), BRK1-YFP signal in spi persisted throughout the entire imaging time course (Figure 6B). In several cases, BRK1-YFP remained visible in nongrowing root hair bulges of spi for more than 60 min. The persistence of BRK1-YFP signal was also observed in short root hair outgrowths of spi (Figure 6C; Supplemental Movie S9). To support our visual observations with quantitative data, we selected root hairs of spi and brk1 expressing BRK1-YFP that were of approxi- mately equal lengths. From these root hairs, the ratio of BRK1-YFP tip fluorescence to subapical fluorescence was obtained (Figure 6D). These analyses showed that BRK1-YFP signal persisted in spi, as demonstrated by the higher fluo- rescence ratio (Figure 6E). In contrast, BRK1-YFP in brk1 root hairs disappeared from RHID when root hairs experi- enced rapid tip growth and thus did not exhibit  fluores- cence gradient at the root tips (Figure ,  and ). In addition, SPI-YPet in brk1 exhibited similar dynamics to SPI- YPet in the complemented spi (Figure 6F). In brk1, SPI-YPet signal was weak during early root hair bulge formation and intensified as root hair tip growth accelerated (Figure 6F). Taken together, these results strongly indicate that SPI con- tributes to the stability of BRK1 during the transition from root hair initiation to rapid tip growth. On the other hand, BRK1 does not appear to have direct effects on SPI during root hair initiation or rapid tip growth.

As such,  mechanistic link between reported SPI subcellular localization patterns and cell growth pheno- types (.. short root hairs and distorted trichome shapes) described in the original spi mutant alleles has been unclear. The large size of SPI and the possibility that it is targeted to discrete cellular domains could have hindered transgenic complementation and subsequent in planta localization efforts. Through our work, we demonstrated that  SPI-YPet fusion generated through recombineering complemented spi (Zhou et al., 2011; Brumos et al., 2020). In doing so, we pro- vide compelling evidence that SPI is  root hair tip-enriched BEACH domain-containing protein.

Although the presence of tip-fo- cused SPI-YPet was strongly correlated with the mainte- nance of the tip-focused -actin meshwork, direct causal links between SPI and -actin have yet to be established. An alternative explanation is that tip growth-induced reduction due to the absence of SPI could lead to downstream, indi- rect effects on actin organization. The root hair phenotypes and corresponding depletion of tip-focused -actin in spi is reminiscent of studies of BEACH domain-containing proteins in mammalian cells, particularly in neurons, which have often been compared to tip-growing plant cells (Balu\u0002ska, 2010). For instance, neuronal dendritic spines are cytoplasmic protrusions that modulate excitatory synaptic transmission in the mammalian nervous system. Actin is  major component of dendritic spines that plays  central role in driving the dynamic shape changes and secre- tory activities of these cytoplasmic protrusions during synap- tic signaling (Cingolani and Goda, 2008). In animals, neurobeachin (Nbea) is  BEACH domain-containing protein that has  similar domain architecture to SPI. Cultured neu- rons of Nbea mice knockouts had fewer dendritic spine pro- trusions and depleted -actin at the synapse than the wild- type (Niesmann et al., 2011). Another BEACH domain-con- taining protein called FAN was shown to be crucial for the formation of filopodia, .. actin-rich plasma membrane extensions that enable motile cells to probe their environ- ment (Mattila and Lappalainen, 2008). FAN-deficient fibro- blasts had reduced filopodia formation and were unable to reorganize their actin cytoskeletons in response to upstream activation by tumor necrosis factors (Haubert et al., 2007). Taken together, these results indicate that actin-mediated regulation of cell polarity by BEACH domain-containing pro- teins is likely to be conserved across animals and plants. The formation of SPI-YPet agglomerates in response to BFA indicates that SPI is associated with post-Golgi com- partments. This result is consistent with observations made with BEACH domain-containing proteins in mammals. For example, Nbea was shown to localize to vesicular endomem- branes adjacent to the TGN, and like SPI, the distribution of Nbea-positive post-Golgi compartments was altered by BFA (Wang et al., 2000). Furthermore, the Caenorhabditis elegans (nematode) Nbea homolog SEL- was demonstrated to function in endomembrane trafficking in polarized epithelial cells based on the finding that sel- mutants mistarget pro- teins normally found in the apical cell surface to the basolat- eral surface (de Souza et al., 2007). Here, the protein secretory marker SEC-RFP, which is typically trafficked to the tips of elongating wild-type root hairs (Sparks et al., 2016), was uniformly distributed in spi root hairs. The absence of tip-directed SEC-RFP gradients in spi root hairs shows that, as in mammals, plant BEACH domain-containing proteins are required for the proper targeting of molecular cargo to points of polarized cell growth. Another significant result from our studies is the discovery that BRK1 and SCAR2 are molecular determinants of the RHID. The localization of BRK1 and SCAR2 to the RHID and their dissipation as root hair tip growth commenced con- trasts with findings in Physcomitrium in which  functional BRK1-YFP distinctly labeled the tips of caulonemal cells (Perroud and Quatrano, 2008). Like BRK1-YFP, an ARPC4- GFP construct labeled the tips of caulonemal cells (Perroud and Quatrano, 2008), whereas no clear tip-focused labeling of ARPC5-GFP was observed in root hairs (Supplemental Figure S5). The observation that BRK1-YFP prominently lo- calized to the RHID but dissipated during active root hair tip growth was surprising given that Arabidopsis BRK1 com- plemented the defective filamentous growth of Physcomitrium BRK1 knockouts (Perroud and Quatrano, 2008). Physcomitrium BRK1 and ARPC4 mutants have clear tip growth defects, while Arabidopsis mutants in the /SC and ARP2/ complexes have only weak to no tip growth ab- normalities (Le et al., 2003; Mathur et al., 2003; Perroud and Quatrano, 2006, 2008). This suggests that seed plants might have evolved  specialized function for the /SC complex at the site of root hair emergence and early bulge formation with only  minor role in driving actin-dependent tip growth. Moreover,  recent discovery regarding the emer- gence of an ARP2/ independent /SC pathway in the reg- ulation of -actin dynamics for sperm nuclear migration in Arabidopsis pollen tubes further indicates that this occur- rence may be more common in seed plants. On the other hand, the knockouts of an Arabidopsis SPI ortholog in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha led to short rhizoids, indi- cating that SPI has conserved functions across land plants in regulating tip growth (Honkanen et al., 2016). In other single cell types such as diffusely growing trichomes, /SC and ARP2/ subunits likely play  more prominent role than SPI 2142 | THE PLANT CELL 2021: 33: 2131 2148 . Chin et al. based on their more severe trichome phenotypes when the expression of their encoding genes is suppressed. The weakening of BRK1-mRuby3 fluorescence coinciding with SPI-YPet accumulation, and the persistence of SPI-YPet signal in spi root hair tips, provides indirect evidence that SPI might play  role in mediating BRK1 stability or localized clustering at the plasma membrane of the RHID. Although it is unknown why BRK1-YFP signal persists in spi, it is tempting to speculate that SPI might modulate BRK1 via protein degradation pathways. This possibility is supported by studies in mammals pointing to  role for BEACH do- main-containing proteins in protein degradation via the ubiquitination pathway. In mouse models, for example, the BEACH domain-containing protein WDR81 was shown to be essential for the removal of autophagy-dependent ubiqui- tinated proteins (Liu et al., 2017). In this regard, it is worth noting that the /SC-ARP2/ pathway was demonstrated to function in stress-induced autophagy (Wang et al., 2016) and that proteasome inhibitors stabilized SCAR during dark- induced primary root growth inhibition (Dyachok et al., 2011). It is possible that SPI-mediated proteolytic pathways and BRK1 coordinate their activities to specify the levels of /SC at the RHID that enable the transition to actin-de- pendent rapid tip growth. However, such  scenario is com- plicated by the observation that the formation of tip- directed SPI-YPet does not appear to require BRK1. This sug- gests that SPI  appearance at the root hair tip is likely regu- lated by other factors besides the /SC complex. Alternatively, the failure of BRK1 to disappear from the RHID in spi mutants may be caused by  general failure to transition to normal tip growth. Future studies will require subjecting root hairs to conditions that prematurely termi- nate tip growth to determine if BRK1 signals persist. In summary, our work provides data that contribute to our understanding of actin-mediated root hair development. crucial result from our work is the discovery that SPI and the /SC subunits BRK1 and SCAR2 exhibit polarized locali- zation patterns in root hairs that point to potential func- tional relationships among these proteins during root hair development. In the future, it will be important to evaluate genetic interactions between SPI and /SC and ask whether SPI physically interacts with actin or subunits of /SC to better explain the functional links between SPI and /SC. Materials and methods Forward-genetic screening and map-based cloning The . thaliana hlb mutants from which the spi- mutant allele was identified were isolated from  population of - DNA seeds (Arabidopsis Biological Research Center stock CS31100). Plants generated from these seeds were trans- formed with the activation tagging pSKI015 plasmid (Weigel et al., 2000; Sparks et al., 2016; Sun et al., 2019). Briefly, mutagenized seeds were surface sterilized in 95% (/) etha- nol and 20% bleach (/), followed by three washes in sterile deionized water. solution of .\u0002 Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal salt medium with vitamins (PhytoTech Labs, USA) and % (/) sucrose was prepared, and the pH of the solution was adjusted to .. After adding .% agar (/ ) (Sigma-Aldrich), the solution was autoclaved and allowed to cool at room temperature. Upon reaching 55\u0004,  stock solution of 10-mM LatB (CalBiochem-EMD Chemicals) in 100% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to make  final LatB concentration of 100 nM. Sterilized seeds were sus- pended in the MS agar LatB medium and gently swirled to evenly distribute the seeds. The seed MS agar LatB mixture was poured to  thickness of  mm on the bases of 10 cm \u0002 10 cm Petri dishes. After incubating the plates at \u0004 for 48 , they were positioned vertically in  Conviron plant growth chamber set to 24\u0004 with  14- light (120 mmol \u0003 \u0003)/10- dark cycle. Six days after transfer to the Conviron growth chamber, seedlings that exhibited severe growth inhibition were transplanted to LatB-free medium and grown to maturity. For LatB hypersensitivity assays, seeds from selected plants and the hlb2 mutant were planted on the surface of   mm layer of polymerized .\u0002 MS % agar growth me- dium in gridded square 10 cm \u0002 10 cm Petri plates and grown in the same Conviron used for screening. Four-day- old seedlings with primary roots that were \u0005 cm long were selected. Selected seedlings were transplanted to  new set of square Petri dishes containing MS medium supple- mented with 50-nM LatB or MS supplemented with the ap- propriate volume of LatB solvent (.. DMSO). During transplantation, the tip of the root was positioned at the grid line of the Petri dish and maintained in  vertical orien- tation. Four days after transplanting, images of the roots were captured with  Nikon Insight digital camera mounted on  copy stand. Primary root length was expressed as the distance between the position of the root tip   after transplantation and the grid line where the root tip was po- sitioned during transplantation (Supplemental Figure S1). To identify the HLB2 gene, homozygous hlb2 (Col- eco- type) was out-crossed to the Landsberg erecta ecotype to generate seeds for map-based cloning because attempts to identify the responsible mutation for the hlb2 phenotype us- ing TAIL-PCR had been unsuccessful. Segregating F2 seed- lings were surface sterilized as described above and grown for  . These seedlings were then transferred to MS me- dium containing 50 nM LatB and root lengths were marked on the plates to track root growth. Transferred seedlings were grown vertically for an additional   in the growth chamber and seedlings that showed root hypersensitivity to 50-nM LatB were selected for mapping. Briefly, DNA was extracted (Edwards et al., 1991) from approximately ,600 LatB sensitive seedlings and cloned with simple sequence length polymorphism and cleavage of amplified polymorphic site markers to chromosome one between the AT1G02740 and AT1G03410 loci (Lukowitz et al., 2000), which spanned 248 kb and contained 77 annotated genes. Primers were then designed to several candidate genes based on the se- quenced 248-kb region. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the hlb2 mutation had  10-base pair deletion (Chr1 The Plant Cell, 2021 Vol. 33, No. THE PLANT CELL 2021: 33: 2131 2148 |\n\nposition 720, 152 720, 161) in exon 14 of the AT1G03060 gene. In addition, we obtained  -DNA insertional mutant (SALK_065311) from the ABRC with  predicted insertion in SPI. After genotyping, SALK_065311 was subjected to similar LatB hypersensitivity and growth assays as hlb2 as men- tioned above. Allelism was determined by examining the F1 progeny from  cross between hlb2\u0002 SALK_065311. Following the nomenclature of Steffens et al. (2015), SALK_065311 and hlb2 were named spi- and spi-, respectively.",

    "text": "Transferred seedlings were grown vertically for an additional   in the growth chamber and seedlings that showed root hypersensitivity to 50-nM LatB were selected for mapping. Briefly, DNA was extracted (Edwards et al., 1991) from approximately ,600 LatB sensitive seedlings and cloned with simple sequence length polymorphism and cleavage of amplified polymorphic site markers to chromosome one between the AT1G02740 and AT1G03410 loci (Lukowitz et al., 2000), which spanned 248 kb and contained 77 annotated genes. Primers were then designed to several candidate genes based on the se- quenced 248-kb region. Nucleotide sequencing revealed that the hlb2 mutation had  10-base pair deletion (Chr1 The Plant Cell, 2021 Vol. 33, No. THE PLANT CELL 2021: 33: 2131 2148 |\n\nposition 720, 152 720, 161) in exon 14 of the AT1G03060 gene. In addition, we obtained  -DNA insertional mutant (SALK_065311) from the ABRC with  predicted insertion in SPI. After genotyping, SALK_065311 was subjected to similar LatB hypersensitivity and growth assays as hlb2 as men- tioned above. Allelism was determined by examining the F1 progeny from  cross between hlb2\u0002 SALK_065311. Following the nomenclature of Steffens et al. (2015), SALK_065311 and hlb2 were named spi- and spi-, respectively. Generation of fluorescent protein-tagged constructs and plant lines The SPI protein was tagged at the -terminus with the fluo- rescent protein 3x-YPet via the recombineering method (Zhou et al., 2011). Agrobacterium tumefaciens UIA143 pMP90 harboring  SPI-YPet recombineering construct was used to transform the spi- mutant by the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998). Transgenic lines were isolated based on resistance to kanamycin and restoration of the wild-type root length. The SPI-YPet transgene was amplified with primers (50-ATTCCACAAGCAACCAGTCAC-30 and 50- AACAGAGTTGAGAGTGGCTCG-30) and sequenced to con- firm the correct configuration. Final validation of SPI-YPet expression was accomplished by screening selected lines un- der the confocal microscope for YPet fluorescence and com- plementation of the short root hair phenotype. SCAR2-mCherry lines were also generated by recombineer- ing in which an mCherry tag was fused to an internal region of SCAR2 (Sharan et al., 2009). The mCherry tag was inserted after amino acid 585 in SCAR2 to generate SCAR2- i2mCherry. Recombineering primers were designed as fol- lows: the forward primer contained 50 SCAR2 nucleotides upstream from the insertion site of SCAR2 and 18 nucleoti- des of the 50-end of the mCherry cassette, which had  \u0002 Glycine,  Alanine linker. The reverse primer contained 50 nucleotides after the insert site of SCAR2 and 24 nucleotides of the 30-end of the mCherry cassette. The JAtY75L14 clone was transformed into the recombineering competent Escherichia coli strain SW105 and recombined with the SCAR2-i2mCherry recombineering cassettes. flippase re- combination reaction removed the ampicillin resistance marker. The sequence between the two test primers was verified by DNA sequencing. The clones were transformed into Agrobacterium and then into scar1234 plants (Dyachok et al., 2008). Because both scar1234 plants and the recom- bineering clones were Basta resistant, plants on MS plates were screened by eye for rescued trichome phenotypes. Rescued plants were genotyped with the recombineering test primers and screened for fluorescence under  confocal microscope. The BRK1promoter: BRK1-YFP introduced into the brk1- mutant and ARPC5-GFP are described in Dyachok et al. (2008) and Yanagisawa et al. (2015), respectively. For the BRK1-mRuby3 construct, the fluorescent protein 3x- mRUBY3 was tagged with  -terminal linker (10 Alanine, Glycine) using Thermo Fisher Scientific GeneArt to include BamH1 and XbaI sites at its 50- and 30-ends, respectively. Codon optimization for Arabidopsis was performed on the 3x-mRUBY3 and internal linkers prior to synthesis. The 3X- mRuby3 fragment was inserted as  BamH1/XbaI into the plasmid pBRK:YFPpEZRK (Dyachok et al., 2008).The Agrobacterium floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998) was used to transform brk1- plants, and transformation was confirmed when this construct fully restored defective brk1- trichomes. Plants expressing BRK1-YFP were crossed with spi- to generate BRK1-YFP in the spi- background. In parallel, plants expressing SPI-YPet were crossed with brk1 to obtain SPI-YPet in the brk1 background. Spi- was directly trans- formed with the UBQ10:mGFP-Lifeact construct by the floral dip method (Clough and Bent, 1998). Spi- expressing SEC- RFP was generated by crossing spi- with SEC7-RFP-express- ing wild-type plants, and progeny in subsequent generations that exhibited fluorescence and the spi root hair phenotypes were selected for analysis. Generation of dual fluorescent protein-labeled plant lines To generate plant lines co-expressing SPI-YPet and BRK1- mRuby3, SPI-YPet in spi- was crossed with BRK1-mRuby3 in the brk1- background. Progeny from subsequent genera- tions that exhibited yellow and red fluorescence and rescued root hair and trichome phenotypes were selected for the analysis. For lines expressing SPI-YPet and mRuby3-Lifeact (Bascom et al., 2018b), SPI-YPet in the spi- background was directly transformed with  UBQ10:Lifeact-mRuby3 construct. Seedlings that showed both YPet and mRuby3 fluorescence were selected under the confocal microscope. Evaluation of root hair growth rate Seeds were surface-sterilized in ethanol and bleach as de- scribed above. To evaluate root hair growth rate, seeds were planted on 48\u0002 64 mm coverslips coated with .\u0002 MS, % sucrose, and .% (/) Gelzan CM (Sigma Aldrich, USA) according to Dyachok et al. (2016). The coverslips were placed in -cm round Petri dishes and the seeds stratified at \u0004 for 48 . After stratification, the coverslip system with planted seed were kept in  24\u0004 growth chamber under  14- light (120 mmol \u00032s\u0003)/10- dark cycle for   . To quantify root hair growth rate, time-lapse sequences of elongating root hairs at intervals of 10 min over  period of 60 min from  region of the primary root located between  and  mm from the root tip were captured with  Nikon Eclipse TE300 inverted microscope using  10\u0002 objective. Root hair lengths at various time points were extracted from digital images using ImageJ (v1.51) software (https:// imagej.nih.gov/ij/). The displacement of the root hair tip af- ter each 10-min interval was obtained and divided by 10 to obtain growth rate as mm/min. 2144 | THE PLANT CELL 2021: 33: 2131 2148 . Chin et al. Chemical treatments of root hairs For BFA treatment,  stock solution of 10 mM was made by dissolving BFA powder (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMSO. Subsequently, the working solution of 50 mM was diluted in .\u0002 MS, % sucrose solution, and loaded into  -mL sy- ringe. The BFA solution was injected directly next to the roots of - to --old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on cover- slips and incubated at room temperature for 10 min prior to microscopy. FM -43 dye (ThermoFisher Scientific) was dissolved in DMSO to make  10-mM stock solution. The dye was di- luted to  mM in .\u0002 MS, % sucrose solution. The dye was loaded into  -mL syringe, and the solution was injected next to the roots as described above. Microscopy and image analysis Live cell imaging of root hairs using confocal microscopy was performed on - or --old seedlings grown on the 48 mm \u0002 64 mm coverslip system described above. Coverslips with seedlings were placed horizontally on the stage of an inverted Leica SP8- point scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Buffalo Grove, IL, USA) or an UltraView ERS spinning-disc confocal microscope (Perkin Elmer Life and Analytical Sciences, Waltham, MA, USA) equipped with 40\u0002 water (numerical aperture   .10) or 100\u0002 oil (numeri- cal aperture  .40) immersion objectives. SPI-YPet and YFP- BRK1 were imaged by illuminating roots growing along the coverslip surface with the 514 nm line of the SP8-XArgon la- ser and emission detected at 527 nm. Images of root hairs expressing SCAR2-mCherry, BRK1-mRuby3, Lifeact-mRuby, and SEC7-RFP were acquired by illumination with the tun- able SP8- white light laser (560-580 nm) and detecting emission at 610 nm. Excitation and emission parameters for GFP (GFP-ARPC5 and mGFP-Lifeact) were 488 nm and 510 nm, respectively. Time-lapse movies or single time point images were collected using Volocity acquisition version .. (Improvision) or SPX- LAS software, for the UltraView and Leica SP8-, respectively. Quantification of fluorescence from root hair images was conducted on -bit confocal images acquired at  single fixed focal plane that spanned the median of the cell (SPI- YPet, BRK1-YFP, SEC-RFP, and BFA and FM -43 treatments) or from maximum projected images (mGFP-Lifeact). For SPI- YPet and SEC-RFP, an oval region of interest (ROI) at the root hair tip was drawn and mean fluorescence within this area was acquired using ImageJ. Fluorescence was expressed as the ratio of mean fluorescence within the root tip ROI to background fluorescence. For SPI-YPet, the background used was the region adjacent to but outside of the root hair tip (Figure 1C), while for SEC-RFP, the background used was an area on the sub-apical region of the root hair tip (Figure 2F). For BRK1-YFP,  ROI was drawn along the apical-most root hair tip that was approximately 20 pixels wide using the se- lection brush tool of ImageJ. The ratio of fluorescence within this area to background fluorescence was obtained (Figure 2C). For BFA,  variable ROI was selected based on the size of BFA-induced agglomerates using the selection brush tool of ImageJ. The ratio of fluorescence was calcu- lated based on similarly sized ROI in the cytoplasmic region. For FM -43 experiment, the same quantification technique as for SEC-RFP was used. Root hair growth rate data for scatter plots in Figures  and  were derived from the same root hair images in which fluorescence images were acquired under  Leica SP8-. For the former, an image of  root hair was taken at time  and every  min thereafter. Scatter plots to determine the rela- tionship between growth rate and tip-focused fluorescence were generated in  ( Core Team, 2019) using the ggplot function in the ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016). Linear re- gression analysis between two variables was performed using the lme4 package in  software (Bates et al., 2015;  Core Team, 2019). Root hair growth rate for Figure 3Q was obtained directly on  Nikon TE300 from root hairs growing in .\u0002 MS, % sucrose, and .% Gelzan in -cm diameter round Petri dishes. Time-lapse images were taken every 10 min over  period of 60 min. The growth rate refers to the displace- ment of the root hair tip in micrometer divided by time elapsed (min). To quantify tip-focused -actin, 25 optical sections were taken at .-mm intervals using an UltraView spinning-disc confocal microscope. Raw Ultraview -stacks were exported to Imaris image analysis software version .. (Bitplane). Transverse sections of the root hair tip were obtained from -stacks using the surpass view interface of Imaris software and exported as -bit TIFF files. From these images, an ROI spanning the circular area of the root hair tip was drawn us- ing ImageJ and mean fluorescence was extracted (Figure 3O). The ratio of the tip fluorescence to background was obtained from 18 to 21 root hairs. Pairwise  tests and ANOVA tests were performed using the lsmeans package (Lenth, 2016) in  ( Core Team, 2019). Violin plots for planar polarity in Figure 5F were designed with the ggplot function in the ggplot2 package (Wickham, 2016). Pairwise Kolmogorov Smirnov test was selected to compare the shapes of two empirical cumulative distributions for planar polarity of two genotypes using the basic package in  ( Core Team, 2019).

This review examines the effects of microgravity on biological processes and their implications for human health. Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system by disrupting key mechanisms, such as  cell activation, cytokine production, and macrophage differenti- ation, leading to increased susceptibility to infections. In cancer biology, it promotes the formation of spheroids in cancer stem cells and thyroid cancer cells, which closely mimic in vivo tumor dynamics, providing novel insights for oncology research. Additionally, microgravity enhances tissue regeneration by modulating critical pathways, including Hippo and PI3K-Akt, thereby improving stem cell differentiation into hematopoietic and cardiomyocyte lineages. At the organ level, microgravity induces notable changes in hep- atic metabolism, endothelial function, and bone mechanotransduction, contributing to lipid dysregulation, vascular remodeling, and accelerated bone loss. Notably, cardiomyocytes de- rived from human pluripotent stem cells and cultured under microgravity exhibit enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium handling, and advanced structural matura- tion, including increased sarcomere length and nuclear eccentricity. These advancements enable the development of functional cardiomyocytes, presenting promising therapeutic opportunities for treating cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarctions. These findings underscore the dual implications of microgravity for space medicine and terrestrial health. They highlight its potential to drive advances in regenerative therapies, oncology, and immunological interventions. Continued research into the biological effects of microgravity is essential for protecting astronaut health during prolonged space missions and fostering biomedical innovations with transformative applications on Earth. Keywords: microgravity; tissue effects; immune system; cardiomyocytes; cancer biology; human health . Introduction Microgravity,  condition characterized by minimal and almost imperceptible gravita- tional forces, occurs primarily in space or in specialized environments designed to simulate this state [,]. In cellular biology, microgravity presents  unique opportunity to study how cells respond to the drastic reduction in gravity  fundamental factor that regulates Int. . Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058  of 23 numerous cellular processes on Earth [ ]. Under microgravity conditions, mechanical forces that influence cell structure and function undergo significant alterations, impacting cytoskeletal organization, cell adhesion, and intracellular signaling. These changes in turn affect critical cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, communication, and survival [ ]. Historically, research on microgravity has been conducted aboard space stations, such as the International Space Station, and on suborbital platforms. More recently, terrestrial laboratories have adopted advanced technologies, such as rotating bioreactors, to simulate microgravity conditions [,,]. These investigations, conducted both in space and on Earth, have gained importance due to their dual applications: safeguarding astronaut health and addressing terrestrial diseases [,,10]. This review aims to explore recent advances in understanding the effects of microgravity on biological processes, emphasizing its implications and applications for human health. . Materials and Methods  comprehensive literature review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Em- base databases. Search terms were structured following the PICOT framework, with the components defined as follows:   Population: Stem cells,  cells, endothelial cells, cancer cells, kidney cells, and bone cells. Intervention: Microgravity, simulated microgravity, or microgravity conditions. Comparison: Cells under normal or standard gravity conditions. Outcomes: Effects on cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, cellular metabolism, organ homeostasis, and immune health. Timing: Publications with no start date restriction, available up to November 2024. The research question, based on the PICO framework, was as follows:  How does microgravity (including simulated conditions) affect stem cells,  cells, en- dothelial cells, kidney cells, and other biological cells compared to cells under normal gravity conditions, specifically in terms of cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, cellular metabolism, organ homeostasis, and immune health? To ensure  comprehensive search, relevant Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms were included. Key terms covered the study populations (.., stem cells,  cells, endothe- lial cells, cancer cells, kidney cells, bone cells), conditions (.., microgravity, simulated microgravity, standard gravity), and outcomes of interest (.., cell proliferation, tissue regeneration, cellular metabolism, organ homeostasis, immune health). The literature search was performed in December 2024 and included publications in English and Spanish. Eligible studies encompassed observational studies, in vitro research, and experimental investigations that addressed the effects of microgravity on critical biological processes. The retrieved results were systematically categorized based on their focus, enabling  detailed analysis of microgravity  impact on different biological functions. The findings were then contrasted with observations from cells maintained under standard gravity conditions, providing  comprehensive comparison of cellular adaptations in these environments. . Effects of Microgravity on the Immune System .. Alterations in Immune Cells Microgravity significantly impacts the immune system, compromising the develop- ment, function, and response of immune cells, which weakens the body  defenses in space environments. Hematopoietic stem cells, essential for generating immune cells, show impaired differentiation into macrophages, critical for infection control. Furthermore,\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058  of 23 an imbalance between M1 (pro-inflammatory) and M2 (anti-inflammatory and repair) macrophages disrupts the immune system  ability to handle infections and repair tis- sues [,]. Dendritic cells, pivotal in  lymphocyte activation via antigen presentation, are also adversely affected. Key molecules such as the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and costimulatory proteins CD80 and CD86 show reduced expression, diminishing dendritic cell functionality. Notably, brief exposures to microgravity transiently enhance dendritic cell activity; however, this effect is not sustained over the long term []. Neutrophils exhibit increased numbers in microgravity but with reduced functionality, impairing their ability to destroy microorganisms effectively. lymphocytes, responsible for humoral immunity, demonstrate decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis. Similarly, natural killer (NK) cells, critical for innate immunity, experience reduced cytotoxic activity, limiting their ability to eliminate tumors or infected cells [,] (Figure ). Figure . Effects of microgravity on the human immune system. This figure illustrates the complex impact of microgravity on various immune cell populations and key molecular signaling pathways. Exposure to microgravity leads to significant alterations in immune cell function, including  shift in macrophage polarization from the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype to the anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype. Dendritic cells exhibit  reduced capacity for antigen presentation, while neutrophil numbers increase, but their functionality declines. Additionally, the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells is diminished, potentially impairing immune surveillance. cell activation, proliferation, and cytokine production are also suppressed, accompanied by decreased expression of IL-2R. At the molecular level, microgravity disrupts critical signaling pathways, including the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK cascade and the NF-  pathway, further contributing to immune dysregulation. These findings highlight the widespread and multifaceted effects of microgravity on immune system function, which may have implications for long-term space travel and astronaut health. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058  of 23 .. Impact on  Cells Microgravity profoundly affects  cell-mediated immunity, disrupting activation, proliferation, and apoptosis. Studies using concanavalin   standard activator of resting  cells revealed significant inhibition of activation and proliferation in CD4+ and CD8+  cells, with the effects intensifying over longer exposure durations. Reduced expression of activation markers such as CD25 (IL- receptor), CD69 (early activation marker), and CD71 (iron transport marker) underscores this dysfunction [11,12]. CD4+  cells, critical for regulating immune responses through cytokines like IL- and IFN- , show  greater reduction in proliferation and cytokine production compared to CD8+  cells. Even brief exposure ( ) to microgravity notably suppresses CD4+ cell functions, while CD8+ cells require longer exposure (16 ) to exhibit similar impairments [11,12]. Cytokine production is notably compromised under microgravity. CD4+ cells exhibit decreased secretion of IL-, essential for  cell expansion, and IFN- , crucial for macrophage activation and antiviral defense. These deficiencies indicate  reduced capacity of  cells to coordinate and amplify immune responses [11]. Apoptosis of  cells is accelerated under microgravity, with an earlier onset of late apoptotic processes. Pre-exposed cells show an increase in late-stage apoptosis and  reduc- tion in early-stage apoptosis, indicating  faster progression through apoptotic pathways compared to controls under normal gravity. This effect is linked to increased expression of the Fas receptor in CD8+ cells,  critical component of the Fas/FasL pathway, which regulates apoptosis through external signals [12 14] (Figure ). .. Impact on Key Molecular Pathways At the molecular level, microgravity disrupts critical signaling pathways, including RAS, ERK, and NF- . The RAS pathway, which governs cell proliferation and survival, shows reduced activity under microgravity, leading to impaired cell growth. Similarly, ERK, which is essential for cell differentiation and responses to external stimuli, undergoes alterations that hinder the activation and specialization of macrophages and lymphocytes. NF- ,  key regulator of inflammatory responses, exhibits inconsistent activation in microgravity, resulting in inadequate immune responses [,]. Research on microgravity has also revealed significant effects on cancer biology, includ- ing the formation of multicellular spheroids (MCS), the reorganization of the cytoskeleton, and the regulation of key proteins such as p53 ( tumor suppressor), NF-  ( regulator of immune responses and inflammation), and BAX ( pro-apoptotic protein involved in programmed cell death). These processes promote apoptosis in various cancer cell types. In cell lines from breast (MCF-), thyroid (FTC-133), and lung (A549) cancers, microgravity- induced changes include decreased cell adhesion and altered gene expression, particularly in molecules like -cadherin (important for cell adhesion and tumor invasion suppression), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF, which promotes angiogenesis), and vimentin ( protein associated with epithelial mesenchymal transition and cell migration), thereby affecting tumor proliferation and dissemination [15,16]. . Impact on Cancer Biology .. Cancer Stem Cells The study of cancer stem cells (CSCs) under simulated microgravity conditions pro- vides critical insights into their behavior in extreme environments, with profound implica- tions for oncology and regenerative medicine. CSCs, characterized by their self-renewal and differentiation capabilities, contribute to tumor heterogeneity, treatment resistance, and metastasis [,]. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058  of 23 In cancers such as breast, lung, and gastrointestinal cancer, CSCs are identified using specific markers, enabling their isolation and detailed analysis. Under simulated micrograv- ity, these cells exhibit significant changes in morphology and growth patterns, including the formation of multicellular spheroids. These three-dimensional structures closely mimic in vivo tumor organization, offering  robust model for studying the effects of microgravity on tumor biology [,,]. Exposure to microgravity induces notable cellular changes, including increased apop- tosis and decreased expression of pluripotency-related markers, suggesting  shift toward differentiation. This differentiation reduces CSC resistance, potentially enhancing their susceptibility to treatments. In gastrointestinal cancers like colon and pancreatic cancer, simulated microgravity has been linked to increased expression of specific markers, re- flecting alterations in the regulatory mechanisms of cell growth and differentiation. These changes can significantly influence tumor progression and the efficacy of oncological treatments [ ] (Figure ). Figure . Microgravity-induced changes in cancer. This figure illustrates the diverse effects of microgravity on cancer cells, with  particular focus on cancer stem cells (CSCs) and thyroid cancer. Exposure to microgravity has been shown to increase apoptosis, or programmed cell death, in cancer cells. It also alters CSC properties, leading to  decrease in pluripotency markers and an increase in differentiation. Additionally, microgravity induces structural changes in the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, which may influence tumor progression.",

Additionally, microgravity induces structural changes in the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix, which may influence tumor progression. In thyroid cancer, microgravity reduces proliferation and overall growth, while also diminishing the malignant phenotype in follicular thyroid cancer cells. Interestingly, despite these inhibitory effects, microgravity appears to increase the susceptibility of cancer cells, potentially enhancing their response to treatments, as suggested by the syringe graphic. These findings highlight the complex and sometimes counterintuitive influence of microgravity on cancer biology. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058  of 23 Microgravity modulates apoptosis,  key defense against abnormal cell proliferation. Many cancer cells under microgravity show increased apoptosis due to altered mechanical forces, while some acquire stem-like properties, enhancing resistance, plasticity, and therapy resistance [17,18]. Microgravity also induces the formation of multicellular spheroids (MCS), which mimic solid tumors and exhibit increased resistance to chemotherapy and radiation, suggesting more aggressive cancer states. Additionally, reduced gravity downregulates adhesion proteins (.., -cadherin, vinculin, paxillin), weakening cell cell interactions and potentially enhancing metastatic potential. The combination of microgravity and ionizing radiation exacerbates DNA damage, genomic instability, and mutations in tumor cells, highlighting the need for protective measures during space missions and offering insights into cancer treatment [19 22]. Simulated microgravity, using devices like the rotating wall bioreactor (RWV) and random positioning machine (RPM), replicates certain effects of real microgravity (- ) but with some differences. High-energy radiation with high linear energy transfer (high LET) increases genomic instability and mutation risks, promoting apoptosis and chromosomal aberrations [23,24]. In gliomas (U251 model), microgravity reduces the activity of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), RhoA, and Nek2 kinase, inhibiting tumor cell migration. Immune cells, such as  lymphocytes and macrophages, show decreased functionality, compromising immuno- surveillance and hindering cancer detection [25 27]. Recent findings suggest that microgravity could offer therapeutic benefits by inhibiting NF- , reducing cancer spread, and decreasing VEGF activity to limit tumor growth through reduced angiogenesis. Changes in the Wnt/ -catenin pathway may slow tumor growth and metastasis. CSCs, typically resistant to therapies, become more vulnerable under microgravity, which also alters extracellular vesicle (EV) protein and microRNA content, opening opportunities for new biomarkers and targeted therapies [28]. The mechanosensitive channel ELKIN1 plays  crucial role in cellular responses to mi- crogravity. Microgravity reduces tumor cell adhesion and invasion, offering potential thera- peutic benefits, but these effects are ELKIN1-dependent. Its absence preserves cell structure and adhesion stability in microgravity, protecting healthy cells during prolonged exposure, but may enhance the persistence of cancer cells, limiting therapy effectiveness [29]. At the molecular level, microgravity reduces the nuclear localization of the transcrip- tional regulator YAP1, limiting excessive cell proliferation and invasiveness. This effect depends on ELKIN1 expression; its absence could lead to resistance or diminished respon- siveness to mechanical stimuli. ELKIN1-mediated reduction in focal adhesion proteins may limit tumor aggressiveness but could pose  structural disadvantage for healthy tissues during extended space missions [29]. .. Thyroid Cancer Microgravity, whether experienced in space or simulated on Earth, provides  unique experimental environment that has greatly advanced our understanding of cancer biology, particularly thyroid cancer [30 33]. For nearly two decades, studies on thyroid cancer cells under microgravity have yielded valuable insights into tumor behavior that are difficult to achieve under conventional laboratory conditions. In microgravity, adherent thyroid cancer cells lose their adhesion properties and organize into multicellular spheroids. These structures closely resemble the physiological characteristics of tumors in vivo, making them ideal models for studying metastasis and evaluating novel targeted therapies [30,31]. Microgravity also affects fundamental cellular processes, including apoptosis, cy- toskeletal organization, and extracellular matrix dynamics, which are critical for cell growth\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058  of 23 and proliferation. Notably, follicular thyroid cancer cells exposed to microgravity have demonstrated  tendency to adopt  less malignant phenotype. This suggests that micro- gravity conditions may induce favorable changes, potentially aiding in the treatment of thyroid cancer [30,31]. The findings from these studies have the potential to revolutionize traditional oncology research approaches. They facilitate the identification of key cellular alterations in cancer pathogenesis and support the development of innovative therapies aimed at improving patient outcomes. Furthermore, these investigations pave the way for novel preventive strategies and more effective treatments based on the unique cellular properties observed under microgravity [30,32]. . Impacts on Tissues and Organ Systems .. Microvascular Endothelial Cells Simulated microgravity profoundly affects microvascular endothelial cells, which play  pivotal role in vascular homeostasis by regulating inflammation, angiogenesis, and vascular permeability [,10]. Under normal gravity, endothelial cells respond to mechanical and chemical stimuli to preserve vascular function. However, under simulated microgravity, significant alterations are observed. One prominent effect is the inhibition of cell proliferation, which delays the repair of damaged blood vessels. Reduced production of interleukin- (IL-),  cytokine crucial for the inflammatory response, further compromises immune functionality and vascular repair capacity [,23]. Interestingly, microgravity stimulates the synthesis of nitric oxide,  critical mediator for blood vessel dilation and angiogenesis. This effect is linked to the activation of en- dothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS). While nitric oxide promotes vascular adaptation, its dysregulation can lead to pathological states, depending on the physiological context [,23]. Research on simulated microgravity has also revealed significant effects on endothelial cell integrity and function. In one study, human umbilical vein endothelial cells, essential regulators of cardiovascular homeostasis, were exposed to simulated microgravity for up to 72  using an RPM, which continuously rotates to nullify Earth  gravitational vector [24]. After 24 , notable changes in cellular biomechanical properties were observed, in- cluding  marked reduction in cell stiffness (Young  modulus) and viscosity. Specifically, cellular elasticity decreased by approximately 30%, reaching critical levels with  75% re- duction after 72 . This loss of rigidity makes endothelial cells more vulnerable to external hemodynamic stress, potentially impairing vascular integrity and increasing the risk of endothelial dysfunction [23,24]. Additionally, endothelial cells exhibited morphological changes under simulated microgravity conditions. Normally elongated and spindle-shaped, cells adopted  distinctly rounded phenotype after 24 . The increase in circularity more than three times greater than that of control cells indicates significant cytoskeletal reorganization, which could affect vascular permeability and the cells  ability to respond to mechanical stress over time [23,34]. At the molecular level, these morphological alterations were associated with sub- stantial reductions in key cytoskeletal components. Western blot analysis revealed  65% reduction in actin filament levels and  26% reduction in  -tubulin,  protein crit- ical for microtubule integrity. Immunofluorescence confirmed these findings, showing discontinuities in cortical actin filaments and abnormal redistribution of microtubules, particularly around the nucleus. These results highlight impaired structural integrity and suggest that endothelial cells may have  compromised ability to respond to biomechanical stimuli [23,34] (Figure ). Int. . Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058  of 23 Figure . Structural and functional adaptations of tissues and organ systems in microgravity environ- ments. This figure illustrates the broad impact of microgravity on various tissues and organ systems, highlighting key structural and functional adaptations. Microvascular endothelial cells exhibit inhib- ited proliferation, decreased IL- production, and increased nitric oxide (NO) production. In the liver, microgravity alters hepatic metabolism, leading to increased lipotoxicity, elevated angiopoietin levels, upregulation of lipid metabolism genes, and dysregulation of immune response genes. Intestinal homeostasis is also affected, with observed dysbiosis, endotoxemia, altered bile acid content, and increased levels of intestinal stress hormones. In terms of bone health and mechanotransduction, microgravity induces significant bone mass loss, accompanied by  reduction in actin filaments and decreased cell stiffness in osteoblasts. Kidney cells experience metabolic alterations, includ- ing reduced oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid oxidation, alongside increased expression of fibronectin (FN1), MMP7, and TGFBI. Reproductive cells are also impacted, with evidence of reduced egg quality, the loss of polarization in granulosa cells, and  decrease in microvilli in eggs. Additionally, cardiomyocytes exhibit increased maturation and functionality, enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis, improved calcium storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, and the formation of sarcomeres and -disks. These findings collectively underscore the widespread and system-specific alterations induced by microgravity, significantly influencing cellular function and overall tissue homeostasis. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058  of 23 Endothelial cells exposed to microgravity also form three-dimensional spheroids, which closely mimic in vivo blood vessel structures. These 3D models are invaluable for studying microgravity-induced changes in endothelial function, enabling more physiologi- cally relevant investigations compared to traditional 2D cultures [,10,23]. Collectively, these findings reveal that microgravity disrupts endothelial physiology, influencing cell proliferation, inflammatory responses, and vascular regulation. These insights have implications for diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, and other circulatory disorders. They underscore the need for further research to mitigate vascular risks during space missions and explore potential therapeutic applications on Earth []. .. Hepatic Metabolism and Intestinal Homeostasis Microgravity,  defining feature of spaceflight and terrestrial simulations, profoundly impacts the metabolism and functionality of various organs, particularly the liver. Experi- mental models using rhesus macaques have shown that prolonged exposure to microgravity induces significant metabolic alterations similar to those observed in rodents. These in- clude lipid accumulation and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the liver, reflecting the disruption of hepatic metabolic homeostasis. Such findings underscore the importance of exploring the effects of microgravity on metabolic regulation in animal models and future human studies [34 36] (Figure ). In  42-day head-down bed rest model simulating microgravity, rhesus macaques developed mild liver lesions, fat vacuole accumulation, and inflammatory cell infiltra- tion. These hepatic changes were accompanied by  marked increase in plasma levels of angiopoietin-like  (ANGPTL3),  key biomarker associated with metabolic disorders and lipid dysregulation. These results suggest that microgravity may induce hepatic lipotoxicity,  phenomenon previously documented in rodents but requiring further investigation in primates and humans to better understand its clinical relevance [34 36]. At the molecular level, transcriptomic analyses of liver samples from macaques ex- posed to microgravity revealed overexpression of genes associated with lipid metabolism and downregulation of genes linked to the innate immune response. These molecular changes could impair the liver  ability to manage metabolic stress,  critical function for maintaining long-term health. Additionally, disruptions in fatty acid metabolism were iden- tified, potentially contributing to lipid dysregulation associated with metabolic diseases such as diabetes and obesity [34,35]. Another noteworthy finding was the impact of microgravity on the gut microbiota,  key regulator of hepatic metabolism through the gut liver axis. Macaques subjected to the head-down bed rest model exhibited intestinal dysbiosis, endotoxemia, and altered bile acid composition. These gut alterations were accompanied by elevated levels of stress hormones, suggesting systemic metabolic imbalance triggered by microgravity exposure [34,36]. The effects of microgravity on liver function and metabolic homeostasis carry signifi- cant implications for space medicine. These findings highlight the need to closely monitor liver function and the gut liver axis during prolonged space missions to mitigate potential health risks. Moreover, the metabolic changes observed in animal models provide valuable insights into terrestrial diseases such as diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This knowledge could contribute to the development of more effective treatments and innova- tive therapeutic strategies in regenerative medicine, ultimately benefiting both astronauts and the general population [34 36]. ..",

Bone Health and Mechanotransduction Microgravity profoundly impacts the mechanotransduction of human osteoblasts. Astronauts who spend prolonged periods in space experience accelerated bone mass loss,\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058 10 of 23 making the International Space Station (ISS) an ideal platform for studying the mechanisms underlying osteoporosis in zero-gravity conditions [37 39]. In this context, innovative experimental approaches have been developed, including the use of microfluidic microchips and collagen-encapsulated cell spheroids. These ad- vanced models enable researchers to investigate how the absence of mechanical loading affects bone cell maturation and mineralization. Studies have shown that microgravity decreases cell stiffness and reduces the levels of filamentous actin,  cytoskeletal component critical for maintaining cell tension and facilitating mechanotransduction. For example, experiments conducted on the ISS using automated microfluidic devices have provided valuable insights into the mechanical properties of human osteoblasts under microgravity conditions [37 39] (Figure ). Results from these experiments reveal that osteoblasts exposed to microgravity de- velop elongated protrusions compared to terrestrial samples, indicating  phenomenon referred to as  cellular softening . This structural change correlates with  reduction in actin fiber density, consistent with findings from prior studies conducted under simulated microgravity [40 42]. These structural and cytoskeletal alterations highlight disruptions in mechanotrans- duction, the process through which cells sense and respond to mechanical stimuli. Without the constant gravitational forces present on Earth, osteoblasts lose the ability to maintain their tensional structure and perform optimally, contributing to the bone demineralization observed in astronauts [38,39]. Further research has utilized three-dimensional spheroid models, which better repli- cate physiological conditions than traditional two-dimensional cell cultures. Collagen- encapsulated osteoblast spheroids subjected to controlled pressures under microgravity exhibited  reduction in the expression of key mechanosensitive proteins, such as Yes- associated protein (YAP). This suggests that microgravity disrupts mechanical signaling pathways critical for cellular regulation and bone homeostasis [37 49]. Mechanotransduction is  crucial process by which cells sense and respond to me- chanical stimuli through interactions with the extracellular matrix. On Earth, proteins like YAP/TAZ translate mechanical forces into gene expression changes, modulating cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Under microgravity, the diminished activity of YAP/TAZ leads to varying outcomes in different cancers, such as reduced cell prolifer- ation or increased invasiveness due to altered mechanosignaling. Understanding these differential responses could inform novel therapeutic strategies targeting these vulnerabili- ties [19 22]. Importantly, the application of compressive pressure partially restored YAP expression and increased pSMAD1// levels, demonstrating that biomechanical signals can reacti- vate essential molecular pathways, even under microgravity conditions. These findings underscore the potential of mechanical interventions to mitigate the adverse effects of microgravity on bone tissue [39 41,43]. The implications of these studies are significant. They not only advance our un- derstanding of how microgravity influences cellular biology but also pave the way for developing therapeutic strategies to combat bone loss in both space environments and terrestrial patients with osteoporosis. Additionally, the creation of devices that simulate mechanical loads could benefit astronauts and individuals on Earth, emphasizing the criti- cal role of biomechanics in maintaining bone health and cellular functionality in extreme conditions [39 41,43]. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058 11 of 23 .. Kidney Cells  recent study utilizing  microphysiological model of human renal proximal tubules investigated the effects of microgravity on the cellular ability to metabolize vitamin  and respond to human serum [44,45]. The findings revealed that short-term exposure to microgravity does not significantly alter essential biochemical pathways in renal cells, indicating that fundamental processes remain intact. In this experiment, renal proximal tubule epithelial cells were cultured in  microphysiological system and exposed to % human serum and vitamin  [25(OH)D3]. Biomarkers such as kidney injury molecule  (KIM-) and interleukin  (IL-) were mea- sured to assess cellular responses [44 46]. Transcriptomic analyses, conducted via RNA sequencing, monitored vitamin  metabolites and key genes involved in its metabolism, including CYP27B1, CYP24A1, and CYP3A5 [44]. Surprisingly, no significant differences in vitamin  metabolism were observed between microgravity and terrestrial conditions. However, exposure to hu- man serum elicited similar metabolic responses in both environments, characterized by metabolic reprogramming, alterations in bioenergetic processes, and the presence of  pro-inflammatory extracellular environment [44 46]. One of the most striking observations was the differential regulation of over 2000 genes after exposure to human serum, regardless of gravitational conditions. Affected pathways included the cell cycle, cytokine cytokine receptor interactions, and chemokine signaling [45]. Notably,  marked reduction in the expression of genes associated with oxidative phosphorylation and fatty acid metabolism indicated diminished mitochondrial respiration, suggesting  metabolic shift in kidney cells [45]. These findings imply that kidney cells, when exposed to human serum, redirect their metabolism toward  proliferation-focused strategy, reducing reliance on traditional energy pathways. Concurrently, significant changes in the extracellular environment were observed, indicative of tissue remodeling. This phenomenon was supported by the overexpression of genes related to the extracellular matrix, including fibronectin (FN1) and transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein (TGFBI), as well as enzymes such as metalloproteinase  (MMP7), which are involved in remodeling and reorganizing the cellular environment. These adaptations may represent  cellular response to protein challenges in human serum or could signal underlying pathological processes [44]. In addition to bioenergetic and extracellular matrix alterations, broader metabolic reorganization signals were detected. Elevated cytosolic cholesterol levels, inferred from the repression of genes regulated by the SREBF2 factor, reflected shifts in intracellular metabolic balance. While these effects were consistent across microgravity and terrestrial conditions, their significance lies in demonstrating how human serum, as an external stimulus, can drive profound cellular changes independently of gravity. These results reinforce the notion that certain fundamental processes in renal cells remain relatively stable under microgravity conditions during short-term exposures. How- ever, they also highlight the need for further research into prolonged microgravity en- vironments, where cellular adaptations may become more pronounced or clinically rele- vant [44,45]. The implications of these discoveries are significant for both space exploration and terrestrial medicine. In the context of spaceflight, the findings provide critical insights into how kidneys might adapt to microgravity, ensuring that essential functions such as filtration and blood compound regulation are maintained during extended missions. On Earth, these studies offer valuable perspectives on how kidney cells respond to metabolic and protein stress, potentially informing the development of advanced therapies for kidney diseases [44] (Figure ). Int. . Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058 12 of 23 .. Reproductive System Ovarian Follicles and Egg Quality Simulated microgravity has provided valuable insights into how this unique envi- ronment impacts egg quality and ovarian follicle development. Ovarian follicles, which are critical for egg formation, rely on intricate interactions between granulosa cells and the egg to ensure proper maturation. However, the specific effects of microgravity on these interactions and the overall evolution of follicles have only recently begun to be understood [47]. In an experiment replicating microgravity conditions, ovarian follicles were cultured in  simulated system. The results indicated that while follicle growth and survival rates were not significantly affected and remained comparable to those observed under normal gravity conditions, the quality of the eggs released was markedly reduced [47 49]. Electron microscopy revealed alterations in the cellular structures responsible for communication between granulosa cells and the egg. These structural changes resulted in  loss of organization within the granulosa cells, disrupting the secretion of essential factors required for egg maturation. However, supplementing growth factors and antioxidants significantly improved egg quality, suggesting that the adverse effects of microgravity could be mitigated through targeted interventions [47 49]. Further analysis of the eggs highlighted deficiencies in the distribution and density of cortical granules, structures vital for maturation. Additionally, there was  notable reduction in the number of eggs capable of releasing the first polar body  critical process in egg development. These deficiencies were linked to increased oxidative stress levels, which further contributed to the decline in egg quality [47 49]. Another key finding was the loss of polarity in granulosa cells, which inhibited the formation of cellular projections essential for interacting with the egg. This disruption impaired communication between granulosa cells and the egg, negatively affecting the maturation process. Moreover, microgravity altered the formation of microvilli in the egg, structures crucial for interaction with surrounding cells. Eggs cultured under microgravity conditions exhibited  significant reduction in both the number and size of microvilli, po- tentially limiting their ability to release factors essential for development [47 49] (Figure ). .. Cardiomyocyte Maturation and Functionality Simulated microgravity has been shown to significantly enhance the maturation and functionality of cardiomyocytes derived from human pluripotent stem cells. One of the most notable improvements observed under these conditions is mitochondrial biogenesis,  critical process for cellular maturation [,10,23,50]. Mitochondrial biogenesis enables cells to produce energy more efficiently,  key factor for the proper functioning of mature cardiomyocytes. Experimental data have demonstrated an increase in mitochondrial content, evidenced by the expression of specific mitochondrial proteins and an elevated ratio of mitochondrial DNA to nuclear DNA. These findings suggest that microgravity stimulates mitochondrial formation, improving the cells  capacity to generate ATP, the primary energy source for cardiac function [,50]. In addition to increased mitochondrial content, simulated microgravity enhances mito- chondrial respiration. This improvement, evidenced by elevated maximal respiration levels and ATP production, ensures the energy supply necessary for cardiomyocyte contraction and relaxation. These observations highlight the potential of microgravity to promote metabolic maturation in cardiomyocytes, rendering them more functional and suitable for therapeutic applications [,50]. Another critical aspect influenced by microgravity is calcium handling,  vital process for cardiomyocyte contraction and relaxation. Cells cultured under microgravity exhibited greater amplitude in calcium transients, reflecting enhanced calcium storage capacity in\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058 13 of 23 the sarcoplasmic reticulum,  structure crucial for regulating intracellular calcium concen- trations. Efficient calcium handling is essential for effective cardiac function, as it enables stronger and more coordinated muscle fiber contractions. These findings indicate that cardiomyocytes cultured in microgravity are not only more metabolically advanced but also display improved functionality consistent with mature cardiomyocytes [,50]. Simulated microgravity also positively affects the structural properties of cardiomy- ocytes. Observations include increased sarcomere length, the functional unit responsible for muscle contraction, and longer -disks, key structures for transmitting contraction forces. Additionally, nuclear eccentricity and diameter were increased, further indicating  higher degree of cellular maturation. These structural enhancements bring cardiomyocytes cultured in microgravity closer to the characteristics of fully functional human cardiac cells, reinforcing their ability to perform physiological functions effectively [,50]. The duration of exposure to microgravity plays  pivotal role in maximizing these benefits. Recent studies suggest that  -day exposure period is optimal for promoting significant improvements in cardiomyocyte maturation. Prolonged exposures of 14 days, however, did not yield additional benefits, indicating  specific time window for max- imizing the positive effects of microgravity. Optimizing culture conditions within this timeframe is essential to achieve the best outcomes [50,51]. Advances in utilizing simulated microgravity to enhance cardiomyocyte maturation and functionality open new avenues in regenerative medicine, particularly for treating cardiac diseases such as myocardial infarctions.",

Advances in utilizing simulated microgravity to enhance cardiomyocyte maturation and functionality open new avenues in regenerative medicine, particularly for treating cardiac diseases such as myocardial infarctions. The ability to produce high-quality, mature cardiomyocytes is critical for developing effective cellular grafts capable of integrating into damaged tissues and restoring cardiac functionality. These breakthroughs represent  significant step forward in biotechnology, with far-reaching implications for the treatment of cardiac pathologies [,50,51] (Figure ). . Impacts on Stem Cells and Cell Regeneration Microgravity has provided significant insights into how this environment influences fundamental biological processes such as tissue regeneration and cell repair [52,53]. Re- search conducted in real spaceflights and terrestrial simulations has demonstrated that microgravity impacts protein expression and the regulation of cellular pathways critical for the growth and regeneration of various stem cell types. One of the most notable pathways affected is the Hippo pathway, which plays  central role in cell proliferation and tissue damage response. Under microgravity conditions, this pathway is temporarily deactivated, creating  favorable state for cell proliferation and tissue repair. These effects have shown particular promise in regenerating organs such as the heart, with potential applications extending to other tissues [53,54]. The replication of microgravity effects in terrestrial simulations opens new possibilities for exploring therapeutic treatments based on this phenomenon [17,52 54]. Findings sug- gest that microgravity could serve as  valuable tool for enhancing the regenerative capacity of stem cells without requiring invasive or complex technologies. Additionally, combining microgravity exposure with the use of certain drugs or microRNA manipulation key regulators of gene expression can amplify the activity of the Hippo pathway and YAP1 protein, further promoting tissue regeneration. These discoveries hold promise for treating heart diseases and repairing other damaged tissues and systems [53] (Figure ). Int. . Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058 14 of 23 Figure . Microgravity effects on stem cell differentiation and regenerative potential. This figure illustrates key findings related to the effects of microgravity on stem cell behavior. Microgravity has been associated with enhanced cell proliferation, potentially contributing to tissue repair processes. Additionally, it leads to the temporary deactivation of the Hippo pathway, involving upstream regulators such as MST1/, SAV1, WWC1-, LATS1/, and MOB1, which in turn promotes the nuclear translocation of YAP/TAZ. Furthermore, microgravity influences hematopoietic stem cell differentiation by activating specific genes and pathways, including RUNX1, which is involved in stem cell establishment, SOX17, which plays  role in maintaining pluripotency, and GATA3, which is crucial for megakaryocyte and erythrocyte maturation. The PI3K-Akt and mTOR pathways are also implicated in this process, with STRIPAK acting as  modulatory factor. Cells cultured under simulated microgravity using an RPM have shown significant alterations, enhancing our understanding of cellular responses to gravity loss. For example, thyroid carcinoma cells (FTC-133) formed three-dimensional spheroids, contrasting with their typical monolayer growth, and displayed changes in adhesion properties and internal organization consistent with spaceflight observations [23,24]. These morphological trans-\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058 15 of 23 formations involved cytoskeletal reorganization, particularly affecting actin filaments and microtubules, which are crucial for maintaining cellular integrity. Gene expression analysis revealed changes in genes related to cellular adhesion and proliferation, including vascular en- dothelial growth factor (VEGF), -cadherin, and vimentin. Moreover,  lymphocytes exposed to RPM-simulated microgravity exhibited decreased activation, mirroring the effects observed in spaceflight experiments. These findings validate the utility of RPMs for ground-based research on physiological changes relevant to long-duration spaceflight [24]. .. Hematopoietic Differentiation Simulated microgravity significantly enhances the differentiation of human pluripo- tent stem cells into hematopoietic lineages, offering  promising avenue for regenerative medicine and cell therapies [55 57]. Under microgravity conditions, hematopoietic stem cells demonstrate more efficient induction of endothelial hemogenic progenitors, leading to improved formation of functional three-dimensional structures. This results in  notable increase in active hematopoietic cells, optimizing both cell expansion and differentiation processes [55 57]. Transcriptomic analyses have identified the differential activation of thousands of genes involved in hematopoiesis, including RUNX1, SOX17, and GATA1. RUNX1 is essential for establishing hematopoietic stem cells, SOX17 for maintaining pluripotency and differentiation into hematopoietic lineages, and GATA1 for the maturation of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes. These gene expression patterns suggest that microgravity creates  favorable environment for optimizing hematopoiesis [55]. At the cellular level, microgravity influences DNA replication by promoting the ex- pression of replication machinery genes such as helicases and polymerases. This enhances efficient cell division,  critical factor for hematopoietic stem cell proliferation and differen- tiation. Furthermore, microgravity modulates the cell cycle, facilitating transitions through key phases such as G1/ and G2/, which are essential for cell proliferation [55 57]. key discovery is the activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway, which regulates cell growth, survival, and metabolism. This pathway modulates proteins such as mTOR, which governs cell growth and metabolism, and Bad, which inhibits apoptosis, ensuring the survival of hematopoietic progenitor cells. By promoting cell proliferation and preventing programmed cell death, the PI3K-Akt pathway plays  pivotal role in the development of functional hematopoietic cells [56,57]. Microgravity also enhances three-dimensional cellular organization, improving inter- actions between cells and their microenvironment. These interactions are vital for forming hematopoietic niches that replicate physiological conditions more accurately. Cultures in microgravity favor the creation of three-dimensional spheroids, which support better differentiation and functionality of hematopoietic stem cells, optimizing the hematopoiesis process. This capability is particularly valuable for developing precise experimental models and innovative cell therapies [14,55,56]. Microgravity modulates hematopoiesis by influencing the differentiation, prolifera- tion, and structural organization of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Pluripotent stem cells exhibit enhanced differentiation potential, increased proliferation, and improved structural organization, as microgravity optimizes conditions for hematopoietic progenitor expan- sion [17,58 62]. This occurs through survival signaling, primarily via PI3K-Akt pathway activation, where increased Akt phosphorylation inhibits proapoptotic proteins such as BAD and enhances cell survival via antiapoptotic mechanisms linked to mTOR. Wnt/ - catenin signaling is also dynamically regulated in microgravity, promoting  -catenin accu- mulation in the cytoplasm and its nuclear translocation, activating genes essential for stem cell self-renewal and differentiation. Additionally, microgravity modulates Notch path-\n\nInt. . Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058 16 of 23 way interactions and transcription factors like RUNX1, crucial for hematopoietic lineage commitment. Structural rearrangements in hematopoietic niches under microgravity alter cell-to-cell interactions and adhesion molecule expression, facilitating the three-dimensional organization of hematopoietic clusters. On  physiological level, microgravity-induced metabolic adjustments enhance responsiveness to hypoxic stimuli, promoting hematopoi- etic maturation. These findings underscore the potential of microgravity-based systems to refine cell culture techniques and provide insights into spaceflight  effects on human hematopoietic function [17,18]. .. Cell Proliferation and Regenerative Therapies Microgravity significantly influences cell proliferation and functionality, representing  transformative advancement for biomedical research and regenerative medicine [63,64]. In studies with pancreatic islets and neural crest stem cells, exposure to microgravity notably enhanced cell proliferation, particularly in three-dimensional (3D) cultures. For instance, pancreatic beta cells exhibited  45% increase in proliferation after two weeks of microgravity exposure compared to controls under normal gravity conditions [63,65]. Microgravity not only boosts cell growth but also modulates specific functions. For example, pancreatic beta cells cultured under microgravity showed  significant increase in insulin secretion, suggesting potential applications in developing therapies for metabolic diseases such as diabetes [66]. Furthermore, co-culturing stem cells with pancreatic islets under microgravity improved cell viability by 20%, highlighting its ability to create  favorable environment for cell development [63,67]. The formation of three-dimensional structures under microgravity is  critical aspect of these improvements. Unlike two-dimensional cultures, 3D models more accurately repli- cate human physiological conditions, allowing for complex cell cell and cell environment interactions essential for differentiation, proliferation, and functionality. Beta cells in 3D models not only proliferated more rapidly but also maintained enhanced functionality, as demonstrated by increased insulin secretion [63,66]. At the molecular level, microgravity appears to modulate key signaling pathways, such as PI3K-Akt and mTOR, which regulate cell survival, proliferation, and metabolism. While further studies are needed to confirm their specific roles in beta cells and neural crest stem cells, these findings underscore microgravity  ability to influence fundamental processes and optimize cell culture conditions [63,65]. Microgravity offers  unique environment that enhances cell proliferation, viability, and functionality in 3D models, with direct applications in regenerative medicine. This environment not only promotes cell growth but also improves the functional quality of cells, which can significantly advance the development of cell therapies. For instance, pancreatic islets cultured under microgravity conditions could exhibit superior efficacy in transplants for diabetes patients, demonstrating increased proliferation and functional capacity, which could greatly enhance therapeutic outcomes [63,67]. . Impact on Pathogen Virulence Microgravity, whether experienced during spaceflight or simulated in terrestrial mod- els, induces significant changes in the genetic expression and physiology of pathogens affecting both humans and plants. These changes have profound implications for astronaut health, space exploration, and the prevention of foodborne illnesses in space environ- ments [15,68,69]. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058 17 of 23 .. Increased Pathogen Virulence and Resistance Under microgravity conditions, bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella enterica and Escherichia coli exhibit increased virulence, antibiotic resistance, stress tolerance, and biofilm formation. This is often accompanied by  reduced median lethal dose (LD50) in animal models. For instance, Salmonella Typhimurium cultured under simulated microgravity demonstrated fivefold higher lethality in mice compared to cultures grown under normal gravity. Additionally, these pathogens have been observed to evade and suppress plant innate immunity, enabling colonization of intracellular spaces. While these processes are also observed on Earth, it remains unclear whether microgravity enhances these capabilities or merely facilitates their study [15,16]. .. Molecular Mechanisms Driving Virulence Microgravity alters extracellular nutrient transport and activates molecular pathways that enhance bacterial virulence. key factor is low fluid shear,  physical stimulus that mimics microgravity environments and is also present in human microenvironments such as the gastrointestinal tract. Low fluid shear conditions favor the expression of stress tolerance and virulence-related genes, including those linked to the type III secretion system (TS3) and iron metabolism regulation. For example, Salmonella Typhimurium ex- posed to microgravity shows increased tolerance to acidic conditions and upregulation of genes controlled by Fur,  critical regulator of iron acquisition and virulence in enteric pathogens [15,68,69]. .. Effects on Biofilm Formation and Stress Response Microgravity also influences the transport of oxygen and phosphates due to the absence of convection, replicating conditions similar to those in human infections. These environmental changes impact gene expression related to stress tolerance and virulence. For instance, Escherichia coli demonstrates enhanced biofilm formation and increased expression of genes responsible for host cell adherence and lesion formation, thereby amplifying its pathogenic potential. However, these effects are not universal; variations in results suggest that the impact of microgravity depends on the pathogen type, culture medium, and specific experimental conditions [15,16]. recurring observation across multiple studies is the decreased expression of Hfq,  key regulatory protein involved in stress response and virulence. Hfq plays  critical role in the adaptation of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens under stress conditions, including microgravity. Understanding the regulatory mechanisms involving Hfq could provide insights into mitigating the risks of pathogen virulence during prolonged space missions [15,16]. Microgravity significantly affects interactions between human pathogens and plants, increasing bacterial virulence and compromising plant defense mechanisms.",

Advances in understanding the effects of microgravity on stem cells,  cells, and immune function have created new opportunities for therapeutic innovations. Alterations in cellular biology under microgravity conditions have been shown to affect diseases such as cancer, osteoporosis, kidney dysfunction, and infertility. Additionally, changes observed in endothelial cell behavior and multi-organ homeostasis highlight microgravity  potential to revolutionize regenerative medicine and deepen our understanding of human physiology in extreme environments. Microgravity also holds significant promise for personalized medicine by facilitating progress in regenerative therapies, immune-based treatments, and approaches to managing chronic diseases. These findings emphasize microgravity  transformative potential to reshape cellular biology and its application to contemporary medical challenges, both in space and on Earth. Int. . Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 3058 19 of 23 As  defining characteristic of space environments, microgravity imposes profound and multidimensional effects on biological and physiological systems, challenging con- ventional notions of human adaptation. The near-total absence of gravitational forces disrupts numerous bodily processes, posing risks to health during and after space missions. Key effects include fluid redistribution, increased intracranial pressure, muscle atrophy, and calcium-related bone density loss. At the molecular level, microgravity alters gene expression, cell signaling, and mitochondrial function, with significant consequences for energy production and cellular health [37 39]. In the immune system, microgravity reduces  cell activity and suppresses immune responses, increasing susceptibility to infections. These effects highlight the necessity of mitigating immune dysfunction during space travel. Similarly, studies have documented changes in the human microbiome, with potential implications for astronaut health and nutritional strategies during prolonged missions. Microgravity research has also led to technological and medical breakthroughs with applications beyond space exploration. For instance, the study of proteins and drug crystals under microgravity has produced purer and more stable structures, offering new therapeutic possibilities for chronic diseases. Additionally, materials research in space has contributed to the development of innovative compounds with applications in both space and terrestrial industries. These advancements enhance the safety and efficiency of space missions while delivering broad scientific and technological benefits [39,40]. Despite these advances, the complex effects of prolonged exposure to microgravity underline the need for further research, particularly in anticipation of missions to Mars and other distant destinations. Experimental models, such as space platforms and terres- trial simulators, remain indispensable tools for understanding the long-term impacts of microgravity and developing effective countermeasures [37,49]. The study of microgravity not only expands our understanding of how the human body adapts to extreme environments but also drives innovations with profound implica- tions for science, medicine, and technology. By pushing the boundaries of what is known, this research establishes itself as  cornerstone for advancements that extend beyond space exploration, reshaping our perspectives on biology and human health [37,40]. . Conclusions Microgravity presents  unique and multifaceted challenge for human biology, pro- foundly influencing cellular systems and physiological processes. This environment, dis- tinct from terrestrial conditions, disrupts key biological functions such as immune activity, cell differentiation, tissue regeneration, and mitochondrial biogenesis, thereby destabilizing homeostasis critical for human health. Emerging research has highlighted the diverse effects of microgravity, including its impact on the immune system, where  cell function diminishes, increasing susceptibility to infections. Additionally, cancer cells exhibit altered behavior under microgravity, providing new insights into tumor progression and potential therapeutic approaches. These findings underscore the need for further investigation into how microgravity influences disease mechanisms and treatment responses. Microgravity also affects the physiology of vital organs, such as the liver, kidneys, and bones, with implications for understanding tissue regeneration. Notably, stem cells exposed to microgravity demonstrate enhanced potential to produce mature, functional cells such as cardiomyocytes, offering transformative possibilities in regenerative medicine for repairing damaged cardiac tissue and other applications. The continued exploration of microgravity  effects is essential not only for safeguard- ing astronaut health during prolonged space missions but also for advancing therapeutic\n\nInt. . Mol.

The ability of microgravity to induce unique biological changes offers unparalleled opportunities to innovate in regenerative medicine, cancer treatment, and the management of immune dysfunctions. By leveraging microgravity as  research platform, medicine and biotechnology stand to gain transformative insights and novel applications, extending the boundaries of our un- derstanding of human biology and driving the development of therapies that can improve health outcomes both in space and on Earth.

The physiological role of MscL in bacteria is osmoregulation; upon  sudden decrease in the osmolarity of the environment (hypo-osmotic shock) water enters the bacterial cell, producing cell swelling and creating tension in the membrane. MscL gates in response to this membrane ten  sion3 acting as an emergency release valve that allows the rapid flow of water and solute and preventing cell lysis. MscL opens  large pore, estimated size of 30   in response to membrane ten  sions close to the lytic value of the membrane. crystal structure of MscL from the homolog . tuberculosis has been solved at . resolution6, (Fig. ). It reflects what is thought to be  closed state of MscL, although much data now sug  gests it may not reflect the totally closed state seen in vivo.,, The channel is  homopentamer with each subunit consisting of two transmembrane domains. Both the  and -terminals have been shown to be cytoplasmic. Although  second structure exists for the . aureus ortholog showing  tetrameric oligomerization,10 further studies have since shown that this ortholog is actually pentameric in vivo, and that the tetrameric re-organization is  detergent-specific process;11,12 hence, only the pentameric structure is discussed here. The bacterial mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, is one of the best characterized mechanosensitive channels serving as  paradigm for how proteins can sense and transduce mechanical forces. The physiological role of MscL is that of an emergency release valve that opens  large pore upon  sudden drop in the osmolarity of the environment. crystal structure of  closed state of MscL shows it as  homopentamer, with each subunit consisting of two transmembrane domains (TM). There is consensus that the TM helices move in an iris like manner tilting in the plane of the membrane while gating. An -terminal amphipathic helix that lies along the cytoplasmic membrane (S1), and the portion of TM2 near the cytoplasmic interface (TM2ci), are relatively close in the crystal structure, yet predicted to be dynamic upon gating. Here we determine how these two regions interact in the channel complex, and study how these interactions change as the channel opens. We have screened 143 double-cysteine mutants of . coli MscL for their efficiency in disulfide bridging and generated  map of protein-protein interactions between these two regions. Interesting candidates have been further studied by patch clamp and show differences in channel activity under different redox potentials; the results suggest  model for the dynamics of these two domains during MscL gating. The dynamics of protein-protein interactions between domains of MscL at the cytoplasmic-lipid interface Irene Iscla, Robin Wray and Paul Blount* Department of Physiology; UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas; Dallas, TX USA Keywords: mechanosensitive channel, MscL, disulfide trapping, protein-protein interactions, osmoregulation *Correspondence to: Paul Blount; Email:  Submitted: 04/16/12; Revised: 05/11/12; Accepted: 05/14/12  Upon gating, the best evidence suggests that the two trans  membrane domains tilt within the membrane; as they do so, the first transmembrane TM1 twists in  cork-screw-like manner in  clockwise direction (when observed from the periplasm), and the channel then opens like the iris of an old-fashion camera. Note that in the crystal structure  vestibule of the closed pore is observed within the periplasmic side of the membrane, with the pore constriction occurring in the cytoplasmic region of the transmembrane domains. Several studies have shown that this cytoplasmic-constriction region is important for channel gating. The -terminal helix (S1) lies along the membrane and has been shown necessary for channel gating.13,14 It appears to anchor TM1 to the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and is thought to guide its tilting within the membrane during the gating process.15,16 The region of TM2 near the cytoplasmic interface, (TM2ci; Fig. ), has also been shown to influence the gating process. One of the residues within this subdomain, N103, has been shown to be incorporated into the membrane upon gating, presumably to accommodate for the longer tilted TM domains in the open state. Several additional residues in the TM2ci region are also crucial for this transition, thus tuning the gating of the channel. Although the structural data from the MscL crystal structure shows that the S1 and TM2ci domains are in very close prox  imity (Fig. 1B), little is known about protein-protein interac  tions in this region and their possible influence in the gating\n\n2012 Landes Bioscience.

Briefly, bacteria expressing each double mutant were grown in high salt media and either diluted in media of the same osmolar  ity (control) or lower osmolarity (osmotic down-shock) with the oxidizing agent copper-phenanthroline. After  brief incubation the bacteria were pelleted, resuspended in sample buffer, run in an electrophoresis gel and visualized in  west  ern blot with  MscL antibody. Interestingly, we found that interactions between S1 and TM2ci domains are so efficient that only . copper-phenanthroline had to be used in order not to saturate the screen. To compare the likelihood of interactions between cys  teine substituted residues from S1 and TM2ci domains, we measured the amount of protein existing as monomer through pentamers in western blots. We expressed the val  ues as the percentage of multimers vs. the total protein. For the multimer value we counted only the trimers to pentam  ers because some single cysteine mutants in S1 can form dimers,15 thus leading to ambiguity. The 3D graph in Figure  summarizes our results. The  and  axis are the residues from S1 (residues  to 12) and TM2ci (residues 93 to 105) regions respectively, and the  axis reflects the percentage of total protein existing as multimers for each double cysteine mutant. Note that the graph shows  pattern where almost no multimer formation occurs between S1 and residues A95, M94 and F93, residues that are inside the membrane of TM2, while the strongest interactions occur between K105 to L102 and S1. The double mutant M12C/N103C showed one of the higher values in multimer formation. These residues are pre  dicted to interact in the closed MscL, and as can be seen in the western blot, the mutated protein exists exclusively as  pentamer after treatment with oxidizer (Fig. 3A and ). Furthermore, M12C/N103C single channel activity could only be seen after treatment with the reducing agent DTT, and the activity disappeared when oxidizer was added to the bath (Fig. 3C). These results are consistent with M12C/ N103C MscL being locked in  closed conformation when disulfide bridging occurs. On the other side of the graph, one of the peaks reflecting multimerization is I3C/I96C. These residues are not predicted to interact in the closed structure of MscL, but still show that more than 50% of the protein in the western blot is forming multimers (Fig. 4A and ). Patch clamp experiments show that I3C/I96C single channel activity can be elicited both in the presence of reducing or oxidizing agents in the bath (Fig. 4C). Interestingly,  more detailed analysis of the amplitude of the channel in different redox conditions showed that in the presence of the oxidizer the channel is stabilized in  sub-conductive state (Fig. 4C and ). Finally, to better understand the interactions occurring between S1 and TM2ci domains, an additional number of double mutants were analyzed by patch clamp and the results are shown in Figure . Mutants I3C/K97C, I3C/N100C and E6C/K101C showed, like I3C/I96C, stabilization in  sub-conductive state process. In this study we use an in vivo disulfide trapping assay to screen 143 double cysteine mutants to generate  detailed map of protein-protein interactions between S1 and TM2ci domains. Furthermore, to understand the dynamics of these interactions during the closed to open transition in . coli MscL, we analyze the effects in single channel activity of different redox conditions by patch clamp. Two sets of mutants have shown changes in their activities under different redox conditions and suggest  model consistent with  concerted motion of the S1 domain and TM2ci. Results In this work we study protein-protein interactions between S1 (S2-M12) and TM2ci (F93-K105) residues in . coli MscL chan  nel (Fig. ) by using an in vivo disulfide trapping assay.17 We chose to perform this in vivo assay because it involves little or Figure .

The mutants M12C/ R104C, M12C/N100C, E9C/K101C and E6C/I96C, similar to M12C/N103C, locked closed under oxidation; however, more substates were observed for mutants in the middle of the two regions and sensitivity to oxidation varied among mutants. Discussion MscL has been shown in previous studies to be, in general, quite tolerant of cysteine mutations. Perhaps partially because of this finding, cysteine trapping experiments have been utilized to address proximity of regions of the protein that are thought to interact. However, in some instances, researchers have been misled by utilizing targeted mutagenesis and disulfide trap  ping experiments, proposing models later shown to be false. For example, S1 was thought at one time to form  helical bundle that served as  second gate.18,19 The major form of evidence for this model was targeted disulfide trapping. However, when the entire region was scanned and disulfide trapping assessed and compared,15 the results were consistent with the newly re-evalu  ated structure: S1 was an amphipathic helix running along the cytoplasmic membrane. There was no evidence that  S1  sec  ond gate  was ever formed during the gating process. We have designed the experiments used in this study to avoid some of the many potential pitfalls of the disulfide trapping approach. First, we have not used  targeted approach.

Second, the amount of oxidant used was carefully titrated to yield the maximum range of disulfide bridging; none of the interactions were forced by high concentrations of oxidant. Indeed, the amounts used in this study are 100 times less than that used to study TM1/TM2 interactions, where the interac  tions may be more insular and transient upon gating.17 Finally, we use an in vivo approach in which the membrane proteins are not solubilized prior to being resuspended in SDS running buf  fer; hence disulfide bridges cannot form in mild detergents that would preserve the pentameric complex while possibly allowing more dynamic interactions not reflecting any normal physiologi  cal state. We believe that the following of these practices when utilizing  disulfide trapping approach yields  more true and interpretable set of data. Our current model for S1 function is that it serves as  sta  bilizer for the twisting and turning of the pore-forming first\n\n2012 Landes Bioscience.

Collectively, the data from this study, as well as many others, have led to  cohesive model of how MscL senses and responds to mechanical forces. We know, for instance, that MscL senses the tension in the membrane; more specifically, changes within the lateral pressure profile.28 The observation that many other mechanosensors also have lower thresholds or are activated by amphipaths suggests this is  common stimulus for MS channels.29 Furthermore, the observation that the channel can function in  bilayer composed of phosphatidylcholine, which contains  zwit  ter-ionic headgroup not synthesized by . coli, demonstrates that neither interactions with negatively charged lipids nor native lipid headgroups are required for normal MS channel activity. Both transmembrane domains tilt within the membrane, and TM1 rotates in  corkscrew fashion clockwise, as observed from the periplasm. Finally, this study has helped to define the interactions between the S1 and the TM2ci domains; the findings are consis  tent with the model of S1 maintaining its association with the cytoplasmic side of the membrane and thus serving as  stabilizer transmembrane domain.15 In addition, all current models for the structural changes that occur upon gating include  tilting of both transmembrane domains within the plane of the membrane. In addition to tilting, for TM1 several lines of evidence also suggest  clockwise  corkscrewing  of TM1 of almost 180 , as would be observed from the peri  plasm; these lines of evidence include EPR experiments,20 disulfide trapping experiments within the pore9 and between TM1 and TM2 upon gating,17 accessibility and gating influ  ences of the sulfhydryl reagent MTSET+ on TM cysteine mutants,21,22 and the engineer  ing of heavy metal binding sites within the pore region. The S1 amphipathic helix, with its two conserved phenylalanines, is joined to this dynamic TM1 by  conserved flexible glycine residue at position 14 that has been shown to have functional significance.,23 Such  helix running along the membrane is observed in many channels including the other mechanosensitive channel in bacteria, MscS,,24 the  slide helix  of KirBac1.,25  putative amphipathic  gate anchor  domain studied in TRPY1,26 and several others where they may also serve as stabilizers. Although TM2 is not thought to  cork  screw  within the membrane, it is thought to tilt within it upon gating. Indeed,  recent study of the dynamics of the TM2ci region has shown that channel gating can be influ  enced by modifications that make this region more hydrophobic.27 One residue, N103, was even shown to transiently insert into the membrane during the gating process in  piston-like manner. Hence, this region shows  dynamics within and along the membrane upon channel opening. The proximity of the S1 and TM2ci regions is obvious in the closed . tuberculosis MscL structure. An analysis of the equiva  lent residues to . coli M12 and N103 is entirely consistent with our results that these residues, when mutated to cysteines, read  ily disulfide bridge and form  channel resistant to opening. On the other hand, several residue combinations, including the dis  tal I3C and I96C, are not predicted to be close in the . tuber  culosis structure, do not lock the channel in the closed state when oxidized, but do stabilize substates. These data are consistent with the models for the dynamics of the S1 and TM2ci outlined above: upon gating the S1 helix slides along the cytoplasmic membrane, where it can interact with residues further up in the membrane portion of TM2 because of the tilting of this latter domain. Thus, overall the double cysteine mutants that bridge at high efficiency fall in two main categories: those that are pre  dicted to be in close proximity from the closed structure and do lock the channel closed under oxidizing conditions, and those interactions consistent with the predicted sliding and tilting of Figure .

Bootha and Paul Blountb School of Medical Sciences, Institute of Medical Sciences, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom, and Department of Physiology, UT Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, Dallas, Texas, USAb Single-celled organisms must survive exposure to environmental extremes. Perhaps one of the most variable and potentially life- threatening changes that can occur is that of  rapid and acute decrease in external osmolarity. This easily translates into several atmospheres of additional pressure that can build up within the cell. Without  protective mechanism against such pressures, the cell will lyse. Hence, most microbes appear to possess members of one or both families of bacterial mechanosensitive chan- nels, MscS and MscL, which can act as biological emergency release valves that allow cytoplasmic solutes to be jettisoned rapidly from the cell. While this is undoubtedly  function of these proteins, the discovery of the presence of MscS homologues in plant organelles and MscL in fungus and mycoplasma genomes may complicate this simplistic interpretation of the physiology under- lying these proteins. Here we compare and contrast these two mechanosensitive channel families, discuss their potential physio- logical roles, and review some of the most relevant data that underlie the current models for their structure and function. acteria are well documented for their ability to survive and grow at extremes of osmolarity. Of particular note are the adaptations to high osmolarity, but these adaptations in them- selves have required the evolution of strategies to deal with tran- sitions in the environment from high to low osmolarity. To un- derstand the latter, we need to describe the former. Bacterial adaptation to high osmolarity is multiphasic and engages the full panoply of cellular regulatory mechanisms, be they controls over gene expression or modulation of protein activity. Understanding the importance of these regulatory mechanisms requires an ap- preciation of the core physiology of the bacterial cell. CORE PHYSIOLOGY AND IONIC BALANCE All bacterial cells that possess  semirigid cell wall containing pep- tidoglycan accumulate high concentrations of solutes in their cy- toplasm to generate and sustain an outwardly directed turgor pressure over the range of osmolarities at which they grow. In Gram-negative bacteria, the accumulation of potassium gluta- mate to concentrations well above those required for biochemical reactions or regulation of cytoplasmic pH is  common aspect of core physiology. Even at low limiting osmolarity (.., close to that level below which growth does not occur due to nutrient deple- tion), potassium concentrations approximate \u0001100 to 200 mM (28). Potassium is matched by  xed charges on macromolecules (DNA, RNA, and protein) and by osmotically active anions, prin- cipally glutamate, but with contributions from  myriad of other metabolic anions that are intermediates in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (69). Although estimates of cell turgor are very dif cult to derive exper- imentally, the calculated values suggest that at low osmolarity, turgor pressure may be as high as  atm (56) (but see also recent work using atomic force microscopy that has suggested much lower turgor [24]). Sudden increases in external osmolarity are followed by  series of physical and biochemical events that all lead to further accu- mulation of solutes, such that at high osmolarity, solute concen- trations in the cytoplasm vastly exceed those outside the cell (16). Many organisms have been studied, and detailed responses have been reported for Bacillus, Staphylococcus, lactobacilli, cyanobac- teria, and Listeria; the best-described responses are those charac- terized for Escherichia coli and Salmonella (16, 30, 33, 40, 60, 82, 83). The  rst cellular response is purely osmotic water leaves the cytoplasm down the osmotic gradient, causing cell shrinkage or plasmolysis. The  rst major physiological response is release of feedback control over potassium uptake, such that this cation ac- cumulates rapidly, leading to both stimulation of glutamate syn- thesis and reversal of the water loss (27). Secondary phases, namely, the transient induction of the kdp operon, which can be sustained if the external \u0002 concentration is insuf cient to restore an outward turgor pressure, follow. The internal \u0002 concentra- tions under high osmotic environments can exceed  . This may be followed by the induced expression of trehalose biosynthesis enzymes and the stimulation of their activity by the accumulated -glutamate. If compatible solutes (betaine, proline, ectoine) or their precursors (choline) are available, then  further phase of adaptation sees the accumulation of these solutes to several hun- dred millimolar (depending on the external osmolarity) and the lowering of the cytoplasmic -glutamate pool (82). Thus, de- pending on both the osmolarity of the environment and its chem- ical composition, the cell may have very different cytoplasmic constitutions. THE CHALLENGE OF HYPOOSMOTIC SHOCK Such adapted cells are exposed to  major threat to their physical integrity if the environment suddenly changes to one of low osmolarity. For example,  transition from seawater (\u0001,000 mosM) to freshwater (10 to 100 mosM) re ects  change in turgor of approximately 22 atm, simply due to the lowering of the exter- nal osmolarity (by the Van  Hoff Law, the osmotic pressure in Published ahead of print  June 2012 Address correspondence to Paul Blount, .

Of course, such osmotic transitions are not con ned to marine bacteria and would be threats to soil bacteria upon rain, intestinal bacteria upon feces excretion into water, and even host-obligatory microbes upon transmission, when saliva or other secretions may partially dry before being taken up by  new victim. The high concentration of solutes in the cell that exists before the transition draws water into the cell. Wa- ter permeability of the lipid bilayer is high and is augmented, in general, by aquaporins. Consequently, the lowering of the external osmolarity generates  huge in ux of water that creates  force acting outwards against the cell wall (note that here the cell wall is taken to be composed of both the peptidoglycan and the outer membrane to which it is attached; see references 75 and 79 for recent insights). Rapid action is required if the cell is to survive intact. Mechanosensitive (MS) channels were discovered in bacteria 25 years ago and were predicted to play  role in solute release in response to excessive turgor (51). Indeed, the existence of tran- sient pore formation in the cell wall and membrane was predicted long before their characterization by electrophysiology, biochem- istry, genetics, and structural biology (19). The eventual con - mation of the roles of mechanosensitive channels in sustaining physical integrity arose out of the discovery of the genes for the two major mechanosensitive channels in . coli, namely, MscS (mechanosensitive channel small conductance) and MscL (large conductance) (46, 74). Both actually have very large conduc- tances, or pore sizes, relative to eukaryotic channels, which are usually on the order of  few tens of picosiemens; MscL, at . nanosiemens, is the largest gated channel known, while MscS con- ductance is  nanosiemen. Although they release excess cell tur- gor, these channels appear to sense tension within the membrane rather than the pressure across it. This is best documented for the MscL channel (57); it appears to sense the biophysical properties of the membrane, speci cally lipid bilayer deformation (67). The presence of either of these channels is suf cient to confer signi - cant protection against rapid hypoosmotic shock (downshock) (46, 59) (see reference 17 for  schematic representation). These two channels re ect distinct families of proteins. As dis- cussed below, the MscS family is quite diverse and  single organ- ism may encode multiple members in their genome, presumably to be expressed and/or activated under distinct environmental cues. The MscL channel is highly conserved, with only  single gene found in any given organism, and its activation appears to be  last-ditch effort for survival. One of the best exemplars of this trend comes from the  rst demonstration of the protective effects of MS channels. Vibrio alginolyticus grows in marine environ- ments and lyses when transferred to low osmolarity. Lysis can be prevented by expressing . coli MscL from  plasmid (62). The genome of this organism, along with those for many other Vibrio species, has subsequently been sequenced. Almost all lack the gene for MscL but possess multiple MscS homologues. The implication is that either the activity or the expression level of the latter MscS- type channels is insuf cient to protect, at least under experimental conditions. An even greater curiosity is the exception to this rule Vibrio cholerae (and the related species Vibrio vulni cus and Vibrio mimicus); this is the group of organisms that are largely halophilic pathogens but that often require exposure to low os- molarity for transmission. During diarrhea brought on by cholera toxin and their transmission through contaminated drinking wa- ter, they are exposed to hypoosmotic shock. Thus, acquisition (retention) of MscL by . cholerae might be an adaptation to the pathogenic niche. MscS FAMILY The MscS channel was the  rst activity de ned by electrophysiol- ogy (51), although it is not clear whether the observed channels were the product of  single gene or two different channels of similar conductance that have subsequently been characterized (46). The identi cation of the canonical MscS channel was  crit- ical event, opening  path to the description of  wide family of channel homologues of great complexity (68). The . coli MscS (MscS-Ec) is  286-amino-acid (aa) protein that assembles to  homoheptameric complex. Most organisms possess multiple ho- mologues that share  region similar in overall composition and predicted structure to that of MscS-Ec at their carboxy-terminal end. In all homologues studied to date, the amino acid sequence is most conserved in the region that has been de ned by crystallog- raphy in MscS-Ec as the pore-forming TM3A helix and the region immediately carboxy-terminal to this, the TM3B helix and the \u0005 domain. Other regions are conserved speci cally within the sub- families that are de ned by the structural variation within the wider MscS family. MscS homologues exhibit additional amino-terminal trans- membrane (TM) helices, and some also exhibit  periplasmic do- main (46). One usually  nds an additional either eight helices or two helices (based on hydrophobicity analysis of the amino acid sequences) (Fig. ). Our unpublished studies show that all the homologues in . coli exhibit mechanosensitivity in patch clamp electrophysiology and can protect cells in downshock assays. The reasons that such channels are not seen in the . coli mutant strain MJF465, which lacks the readily detectable MscS, MscK, and MscL channels, are complex and beyond the immediate scope of this review. While the large majority of MscS homologues have addi- tional amino-terminal TM domains,  smaller group of homo- logues have modi cations to the carboxy-terminal domain. The YbdG family has an \u000150-amino-acid insertion between the upper \u0005 and lower \u0006\u0005 domains that form the majority of the cytoplasmic domain (70). Other homologues have been reported to exhibit extensions at their carboxy termini such that the  alpha-beta  domain is replaced by  unique protein sequence (.., MscS-Cg [Fig. ]). Still others may be evolutionarily related to MscS but have largely either lost or diminished their mechanosensitive properties (20). MscS STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION The core domain of MscS-Ec comprises three TM domains (TM1, TM2, and TM3A), an amphipathic helix (TM3B) that lies along the membrane surface and projects into the cytoplasm,  \u0005 do- main,  mixed \u0006\u0005 domain, and  carboxy-terminal \u0005 sheet (Fig. 2A) ().",

MscS STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION The core domain of MscS-Ec comprises three TM domains (TM1, TM2, and TM3A), an amphipathic helix (TM3B) that lies along the membrane surface and projects into the cytoplasm,  \u0005 do- main,  mixed \u0006\u0005 domain, and  carboxy-terminal \u0005 sheet (Fig. 2A) (). The assembled cytoplasmic domains in the homohep- tamer form  large balloon-like structure that is delimited at the membrane surface by the entrance to the pore de ned by the seven TM3A helices and at the base by  \u0005 barrel that is both narrow and lined with hydrophobic residues, such that it is unlikely that either water or solutes can pass. Ions and solutes access the transmem- brane pore by passing through lateral portals created at the inter- faces between the \u0005 and \u0006\u0005 domains (Fig. 2A). Although the pri- Minireview September 2012 Volume 194 Number 18 jb.asm.org\n\nmary descriptions of the structure of MscS-Ec have been via crystallography, there have also been important contributions from other biophysical approaches, in particular, continuous- wave electron paramagnetic resonance (CW-EPR) of MscS-Ec mutants in which cysteine residues have been introduced (71, 76, 77). The membrane-embedded domain can be considered to have two components: TM1-TM2 (TM1-) and TM3a. TM1- form  helix pair that is predicted to move in the bilayer as  rigid body sensing bilayer tension (80). Movements of this helix pair are consid- eredtotriggerchangesinthepackingoftheTM3Ahelices,generating an open pore from the closed state (Fig. 2B). The TM3A helices are tightly packed, and they appear in crystal structures to be in  semi- symmetrical arrangement (61). The interfaces of the helices are com- posed of matching knobs and grooves created from  semiconserved pattern of Gly and Ala residues (, 26). The seal that prevents solute ingress or exit in the absence of  triggering signal is composed of two ringsofLeuresidues(L105andL109inMscS-Ec).Mutationsatthese positionsthatdecreasethehydrophobicityofthesealleadtochannels that gate at lower tensions than the parental channel (26, 54, 55). Sukharev and colleagues have proposed that the hydrophobicity of the seal residues creates  zone that is not readily hydrated, and thus, in the absence of  continuous water phase in the pore, no ions can passdespiteanapparentlyopenporethatisapproximately4to5 in diameter in the crystal structure (). The mechanism of sensing membrane tension remains contro- versial, and the structural transitions during gating are still in dis- pute. What is clear is that the opening of the channel requires the movement apart of the leucine residues that constitute the seal (Fig. 2B). Sukharev has estimated that the open pore must have  diameter of 14 to 16   (73). We solved the structure of an open form of  mutant (A106V) of the MscS-Ec channel in 2008 and found that the open pore in this crystalline state had  diameter of \u000113 to 14   (80). Moreover, the HOLE program predicted that this structure may have  conductance equal to that reported for MscS. Such predictions are always perilous, but the overall open structure of A106V is consistent with the requirements for ion conduction. Namely, the leucine residues have rotated away from the center of the pore with the side chains in  more peripheral FIG  () Structure of the closed form of MscS-Ec (2oau) (, 72).

The radial movement of the TM3A helices, accompanied by  small rotation, com- pletely removes the seal residues (L105 and L109) from the center of the channel, leaving  large open pore.

In addition, MscS-Cg, which is an MscS homologue from Corynebacterium glutamicum that is similar to MscS along its length from the amino terminus to the base of the \u0005 domain, is shown. Thereafter, the sequences diverge, and the MscS-Cg protein has  long, essentially cytoplasmic extension (note, however, that this domain contains  potential transmembrane span located 300 amino acids after the end of \u0005 domain). The hydrophobicity plot scale is \u0007. units, and any segment averaged over 19 residues that has  value above . at any point in the window has the potential to form  transmembrane span (44). scale bar representing 100 amino acids is shown, and all the homologues are on the same scale. Minireview 4804 jb.asm.org Journal of Bacteriology\n\nlocation and the TM3A helices have moved outwards from the center (Fig. 2B). speci  prediction made by the structure is that in the open state, TM3A helices have moved apart, breaking the Ala-Gly interface. We have reasoned that the pivotal role identi-  ed for the Ala-Gly interface is in the guidance of the helices in the initial stages of the closed-open transition and vice versa (26). Consistent with this, we have shown that one speci  mutation to the Ala-Gly interface (A102G) does not block the opening of the channel but does severely diminish the stability of the open state, as if the channel initiates the structural transition toward the open state and then collapses back due to the absence of the stabilizing Ala residue. The new structure also allowed speculation about an arcane property of MscS-Ec the inactivation of MscS-Ec chan- nels exposed to increased bilayer tension. One explanation that we posited from the new structure is that the unstable nature of the pore helices in the open state increases the probability that rather than an ordered return to the closed state, one or more helices collapse into the pore, leading to  nonrecoverable block (80). Much has been written about the inactivation of this channel (, , 10, 15). However, this property is unlikely to be  core feature of the MscS family and thus may be just one more variation on the theme. Other mechanosensitive channels that are variants on MscS, .., MscMJ and MscMJLR from Methanococcoides jann- aschii (41) and MscCG (18), do not show inactivation in the ex- periments that have been described. Similarly, MscK does not in- activate (46). We have recently reviewed in detail the structural transitions associated with gating (80). There is common ground among the groups working on these channels that TM1- senses tension and moves in such  way as to transmit  conformational change via the TM2-TM3A linker that, in turn, generates the opening twist that is required to initiate the transition from closed to open. Space does not allow  revisiting of all the arguments and pro- posed structures. Safe to say that much remains to be done in this area, and new approaches are essential if de nitive progress is to be made. MscL FAMILY: CONTRASTS WITH MscS MscL contrasts with MscS on many levels. While several species are predicted to contain multiple MscS proteins, usually only one MscL is found. It is almost ubiquitous throughout the bacterial kingdom but is not observed in plants, whereas MscS is (31). In- stead,  simple BLAST search shows that MscL is found in numer- ous members of the fungal and oomycete kingdoms, including the genera Phytophthora, Neurospora, Myceliophthora, Pirifor- mospora, and Batrachochytrium. The location of these channels in the cell is far from clear, and no analysis of cellular location has been reported. In contrast, the plant MscS homologues have been found in both organelles and plant cell membranes (78, 81). As indicated above, MscL is absent from most Vibrio species. But MscL is also found in the majority of Mycoplasma species. This is perhaps an unexpected  nding given the wall-less nature of these organisms. The most bizarre of these is the MscL observed in Mycoplasma gallisepticum, in which the protein is predicted to be 220 amino acids in length (the MscL-Ec protein is typically 136 aa), and only the  rst part of the protein to the beginning of the periplasmic loop is conserved. Again, MscS is absent from nearly all the mycoplasmas, being present only in Acholeplasma laidlawii. Thus, MscL distribution among microbes does vary and might be speci cally lowered in abundance among marine species. MscL is highly conserved (, 52, 68). Except for the myco- plasma MscL domain structure noted above, it always contains the following conserved domains: an amphipathic \u0006 helix (S1) that lies along the cytoplasmic membrane,  highly conserved  rst transmembrane domain (TM1) that forms the pore constriction,  periplasmic loop,  second transmembrane domain (TM2) that faces the lipid membrane, and  linker that leads to  cytoplasmic \u0006-helical bundle. Two crystal structures have been resolved:  pentameric Mycobacterium tuberculosis MscL (MscL-Tb) (21) and  tetrameric Staphylococcus aureus MscL (50); however, we now know that, in vivo, . aureus MscL is pentameric, not tetrameric, with the tetrameric structure resolved in the crystal being  deter- gent-dependent oligomeric rearrangement (25, 36); thus, only the former structure is shown in Fig. . The small variations between orthologues lie in the length of the -terminal region (sometimes having numerous residues prior to the predicted S1 helix) and the length and sequence of the periplasmic loop, and some ortho- logues contain numerous amino acids after the predicted cyto- plasmic helical bundle (52). However, this variability is extremely modest compared with that of MscS. Of the MscL orthologue channels that have been characterized electrophysiologically (29, 58, 59), the differences in channel activities observed are also rel- atively modest. Some differences in mechanosensitivity and kinet- ics and perhaps  25% variability in conductance have been ob- served; none of the MscL channels have been found to be dependent upon ionic conditions or other factors, as may be the case for the diverse MscS family of channels (47). Finally, the presence of  single MscL per organism is consistent with  chan- nel that is highly conserved both structurally and functionally. As mentioned above, MscL appears to be  last-ditch effort for FIG  Current models of the MscL channel. The top panels depict the crystal structure obtained for MscL-Tb, as observed across the plane of the mem- brane, with the approximate locations of the membrane shown as horizontal lines (left) or from the periplasmic side of the membrane (right); note the black arrow in the latter near the green subunit which describes the corkscrew move- ment of TM1 that is predicted to occur early in the gating process.

Functionally, MscL can be redundant with MscS channels in that it protects the organism from osmotic shock (note, however, that this needs to be formally demonstrated for fungal and mycoplasma organisms). Double-null (.., MscL\b MscS\b) . coli strains are robust organisms under most condi- tions, including osmotic balancing when compatible solutes are accumulated and \u0002 is released. However, they are osmotically fragile during hypoosmotic shock (46). They can be rescued by either MscS or MscL expressed from the chromosome (.., the normal levels of expression of either channel are suf cient to pre- vent major loss of viability). This is akin to the rescue demon- strated for . alginolyticus referred to above, but in this organism, there is the anomaly of the presence of multiple MscS homologues in the chromosome. MscL, when open, makes very large pores in the membrane that are \u000130   in diameter, as determined by molecular sieving experiments for the . coli MscL (23), making it the largest gated pore known. As one would expect for such  large pore, keeping it closed is  priority for the cell. Indeed,  plethora of genetic evi- dence now indicates that if this channel is gated inappropriately, such that it opens at low membrane tensions, its presence is dev- astating for the cell (, , 53, 65). THE RESILIENCE OF THE MscL PROTEIN ALLOWS IN VIVO GENETIC STUDIES TO DEFINE STRUCTURAL CHANGES THAT OCCUR UPON GATING Given that MscL is so highly conserved, both structurally and functionally, one might suspect that small changes would result in radically different phenotypes in channel activities. This, however, appears not to be the case. On the order of 90% of single-residue changes yield little or no discernible cellular phenotype (45). This  resilience  has been advantageous for the study of the channel using both random and site-directed mutagenesis, as well as for in vivo screens, thus allowing for  relatively unique handle on the system. Such approaches have led the way for the proposal of new models for channel gating, as well as for supporting or refuting existing ones. In an initial study,  randomly mutated MscL-Ec was expressed in  mscL-null host cell in trans using an inducible promoter (65). The expression levels were relatively low, only  few fold higher than those of the endogenous gene (14). The bacteria were initially plated on noninducing plates, and then replica plating was used to transfer the grown colonies onto plates containing IPTG (isopro- pyl-\u0005--thiogalactopyranoside) to induce expression. Cells that showed  slowed- or no-growth gain-of-function (GOF) pheno- type on the IPTG-containing plates were isolated from the paren- tal plate and further characterized. The severity of these GOF phe- notypes correlated well with  left shift of the sensitivity curve, as assayed by patch clamp, demonstrating that the channels became more sensitive to membrane tension. Many of the mutations were in TM1, which, we now know from the crystal structure, lines the pore. Of these mutations, almost all were changes to more-hydro- philic residues, which led to the notion that an increase in hydro- philicity within the pore led to channels that are more sensitive to bilayer tension. Subsequent studies yielded similar  ndings and also highlighted residues at the aqueous/lipid interface as being important (45, 53, 86). Since these initial random mutagenesis studies, several addi- tional studies have used in vivo screens to deduce the structural changes that occur upon gating. For example, random mutagen- esis designed to isolate intragenic suppressors of known GOF mu- tants supported  model for  signi cant clockwise rotation (as viewed from the periplasm), or  corkscrewing,  of TM1, almost 180 , occurring upon the gating process (48); such  rotation had been predicted from EPR studies (66). This model was later addi- tionally supported by  new in vivo technique to test channel opening, coined the electrostatic repulsion test (ESReT) (49). Di- sul de trapping of closed channels (45) and the engineering of heavy-metal-binding sites within the pore (34) have also sup- ported the corkscrew model. One of the more-unique approaches used allows the in vivo posttranslational modi cation of the chan- nel. Here, cysteine mutants are expressed in mscL-null cells, sulf- hydryl reagents with speci  properties are added to the medium, often upon osmotic downshock, and viability is determined. This approach was initially used for  single cysteine mutant within the pore that was modi ed with the positively charged sulfhydryl MTSET\u0002 () but later expanded as  screen for an entire cysteine library (). For this positively charged compound, the predomi- nant hits were again within the pore and supported the TM1 cork- screw model. More recently, hydrophobic sulfhydryl reagents have also been used (35) and have led to  model in which  residue at the TM2 cytoplasmic interface transiently interacts with the lipid membrane upon gating (35). Hence, these rapid in vivo screens have been invaluable in supporting and suggesting models for many of the structural changes that occur upon gating. In sum, the in vivo screens, when combined with other studies, have led to the following model for gating. First, some data indi- cate that the crystal structure may be close to, but not completely in, the fully closed state in vivo (34, 45). TM2 senses the biophys- ical perturbation in the membrane under tension. Thinning of the membrane is not what is sensed; instead, it is probably changes in the lateral pressure pro le (67). Although the regions at or near the membrane interface are important (53, 86), direct interactions with speci  head groups do not appear to be important for nor- mal function (57); indeed, when such interactions are created, they can be disadvantageous (86). Both TM1 and TM2 tilt within the membrane (66), while the  rst transmembrane helix rotates in  corkscrew fashion (, , 34, 66). The channel then presumably opens like the iris of  camera, with TM1 forming the pore (, , 66). The -terminal amphipathic helix remains along the cyto- plasmic membrane, where it serves as  stabilizer for TM1 as it tilts and rotates (22, 37). This stabilizer is sometimes called   slide helix  or  anchor  and is seen in several channels, suggesting  more conserved function (37). Although initially controversial (, 87), it now appears that the -terminal bundle remains intact in the open structure, with the TM2-to-bundle linker creating  ve portals that can act as potential molecular sieves (85), while the TM2 cytoplasmic interface appears to be dynamic and enters the membrane during the gating process (35). CONCLUDING REMARKS AND SPECULATIONS It has been  given for many years that both MscS and MscL ful ll major roles in protecting cell integrity by serving the function of biological emergency release valves (46). However, while this is true, there may be many exceptions to this rule that have yet to be elucidated. Some key questions can be de ned. () Do all bacterial MS channels, irrespective of their structure, play only the role of emergency release valve? Unambiguously, this is not the case for . coli, for which there are  ve MS channels that do not ful ll this role (68). Alternative roles might be found in the Minireview 4806 jb.asm.org Journal of Bacteriology\n\nwork on chloroplast MS channels (78). These belong to the MscS family, and hints that they may in uence shape maintenance and organelle division have arisen from their study (31, 32). Given that chloroplasts are intracytoplasmic, they have no need to survive major changes in osmolarity. However, they might be essential in adjusting chloroplast volume during day/night cycles. change in solute pools of around 40 mM is equivalent to \u0001 atm, and there- fore, variations in the concentrations of carbon cycle intermedi- ates and other metabolites may be  signi cant stress. In isolated membranes (.., patch clamp), channels may have thresholds measured in . atm (\u0001 mM solute change) and thus might be engaged in metabolite pool management. While this would still be an osmotic role, protein colocalization studies have suggested proximity between chloroplast division machinery and the MS channels and this may couple osmotic changes to shape control and division. (ii) What do the differing portfolios of mechanosensitive chan- nel homologues tell us about evolution to niche and/or creation of modi ed functions associated with MS channels? We have alluded above to the observed differences in MS channel distribution from the  norm. Both Mycoplasma and Vibrio species may have mod-  ed their pro les of MS channels to re ect their major environ- mental hurdles. Can we learn more about an organism  niche from an evaluation of gene pro les and their expression matrices? (iii) How many copies of  channel does the cell need for sur- vival? Recent work has suggested that, in contrast to previous studies, MscL may exist at 200 channels per cell (12). Many studies have shown that channel abundance in membrane patches does not always correlate with measured channel activity. Thus, do all channels exist in multiple states, only some of which are poised to be activated (15, 38)? (iv) In fungi, where are the MscL channels subcellularly? What is their function, and how do localization and function match up? Could these channels have  role in the complex life cycle that some fungi and oomycetes undertake, which often includes severe transitions in osmolyte and water content? () Can the conserved nature of MscS and MscL be the Achil- les  heel for bacteria? Much work has established the toxicity of MscL, MscS, MscK, and MscG mutants that gate inappropriately (, 45, 47, 53 55, 64, 65). Can we trigger gating using chemicals and, in this way, generate new antibiotics that act synergistically with compounds that weaken bacterial cell envelopes? Such spec- ulation has been made previously (13, 39, 63). In theory, the con- served nature of MscL can be exploited for developing broad- spectrum antimicrobials. (vi) Bacterial mechanosensitive channels are some of the larg- est gated pores; MscL is perhaps the largest known (23). Seminal research has shown how these nanopores can be utilized for the delivery of peptides and other membrane-impermeable com- pounds. Indeed, the observation that  charge within the MscL pore can gate the channel has led to the engineering of nanopores that are actuated by light (43) and pH (42). We can now not only change the modality of MscL but also control the compounds that may pass through it (84), as well as reversibly modulate the pore size (85). Such channels may someday be utilized in  variety of nanodevices, including targeted drug delivery systems. Mechanosensitive channels have provided  paradigm for transient pore formation in bacterial membranes for almost 20 years. Much has been discovered about the structures and some of the structural transitions that they undertake. Yet much still re- mains to be discovered about the precise structural changes asso- ciated with the open and transition states, and these channels re- main fertile ground for technology development.",

It is one of the best studied mechanosensitive channels and serves as  paradigm for how  protein can sense and respond to membrane tension. Two MscL crystal structures of the orthologs . tuberculosis and . aureus have been solved showing pentameric and tetrameric structures, respectively. Several studies followed to understand whether the discrepancy in their stoichiometry was  species difference or  consequence of the protein manipulation for crystallization. Two independent studies now agree that the full-length . aureus MscL is actually  pentamer, not tetramer. While detergents appear to play  role in modifying the oligomeric state of the protein,  cytoplasmic helical bundle has also been implicated. Here, we evaluate the role of the -terminal region of . aureus MscL in the oligomerization of the channel in native membranes by using an in vivo disulfide-trapping technique. We find that the oligomeric state of . aureus MscLs with different -terminal truncations, including the one used to obtain the tetrameric . aureus MscL crystal structure, are pentamers in vivo. Thus, the -terminal domain of the . aureus protein only plays  critical role in the oligomeric state of the SaMscL protein when it is solubilized in detergent.

The same group recently obtained  second crystal structure from  -terminal truncated . aureus MscL (SaMscL) in what they speculated to be an expanded intermediate state; surprisingly, this was  tet- ramer. different oligomeric state was unexpected given that the two orthologs are highly conserved [Fig. ()], as is the entire MscL family. To fur- ther investigate the discrepancy between the stoichi- ometry of these two channels, several studies have been performed. In one study, we developed an in vivo disulfide-trapping assay to determine the state of the . aureus channel when in its native membrane environment; it was unambiguously  pentamer, demonstrating that the crystal did not reflect  native state of the protein. Thus, two possibilities existed: either the truncation of the -terminal bundle altered channel stoichiometry to tetramer, or the detergent solubilization did. Using crosslinking, sedimentation equilibrium centrifuga- tions and light scattering, we concluded that on sol- ubilization with the detergent -dodecyl-,-dime- thylamine--oxide (LDAO), which was used to obtain the crystal structure, the channel reversibly reorganizes as  tetramer; in contrast, TritonX-100 and pentaethylene glycol monooctyl ether (C8E5) detergents did not alter stoichiometry. However, the influence of protein truncation was not assessed. Indeed, one previous study of in vitro translated and -Octyl-Beta--Glucopyranoside (OG) solubi- lized EcoMscL implied that the -terminal end of the protein played  critical role in assembly.10 Recently, using  new technique coined oligomer characterization by addition of mass (OCAM), the Rees  group confirmed that both MtMscL, and full length (FL) SaMscL are pentamers when solubilized in -Dodecyl --maltoside (DDM); but they also showed that  SaMscL with the -terminal deletion, as used in the crystallographic study, was heteroge- neous in its oligomeric state, existing as both pen- tamers and tetramers. Thus, it appeared that the - terminal helical bundle does influence the oligomeric state of the protein. However, because both of these Figure .

Here, we utilize our in vivo disulfide-trapping assay to address this issue. To evaluate the role of the -terminal region of SaMscL in its oligomeric state, we have generated multiple -terminal truncated constructs of different lengths that have two cysteine mutations (L10C/ M91C; Fig. ). As can be seen in Figure (), these two sites are predicted to be in close proximity in the closed state3 and have been shown previously to generate the most efficient in vivo crosslinking. We investigated the FL channel as well as four different -terminal deletions: D95 (which was the truncation crystallized as  tetramer), D99, D103, and D107. Two of these truncations, D95 and D99, are located in the linker between TM2 and the cytoplasmic helix and the other two are in the cytoplasmic helix itself [Fig. (,)]. As previously described, bacteria expressing the different constructs were given an os- motic shock in the presence of copper phenanthro- line; this removes cellular reducing agents such as glutathione while adding an oxidant. The treated cells were pelleted, resuspended in sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) loading buffer, and the MscL protein visualized by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and western blot. Note that the protein is trapped in its native membrane environment because no solubilization or protein handling is involved before SDS PAGE. As shown in Figure  (left and center panels), SaMscL exists almost exclu- sively as  pentamer regardless of the length of the -terminal truncation. Although  ladder of mono- mer through pentamer can be observed for 10C/91C D95 SaMscL in the no-shock/nontreated protein, in the presence of an oxidizer the pentamer becomes the prevalent band in  time dependant manner (Fig. , right panel). Note that for the SaMscL single cysteine mutants under the same treatment, no other species than monomer was observed for M91C but  small proportion of L10C existed as dimmers (Supplemental information). Dimerization of L10C was expected as the equivalent mutant from EcoMscL, M12C, also form dimmers under similar treatment.11 Finally, we show by patch clamp of native membranes that both FL and D95 truncated 10C/91C SaMscL respond similarly to changes in the redox potential of the bath (Fig. ). In the presence of the reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT), both channels are functional and activity can be observed in response to negative pressures applied to the membrane patch (left traces). After perfusion with  % peroxide solution, channel activity could no lon- ger be elicited even under high negative pressures (right traces). These results are consistent with the channels being locked closed after disulfide trapping, suggesting that in native membranes the FL and truncated channels are structural and functionally similar. Hence, in vivo the -terminal helical bundle plays no detectable role in proper pentameric assembly. Many previous studies have concluded that MtMscL and EcoMscL are also pentamers. study using crosslinking, sedimentation equilibrium, and size-exclusion chromatography showed EcoMscL as  pentamer;12 another study using crosslinking and electron microscopy reached the same conclusion.10 The crystal structure of MtMscL as well as the recent OCAM analysis also showed  pentameric structure for this ortholog.13 Finally, when studied by using our in vivo disulfide trapping in native membranes, all three MscL homologs have shown pentameric stoichiometry (Supplementary Informa- tion). Hence, there appears to be no variability in the oligomeric state of these MscL orthologs. Collectively, the data suggest that the -termi- nal domain of the SaMscL channel only plays  Figure . Disulfide trapping experiments show that -terminally truncated SaMscL protein exists as  pentamer in vivo.

All samples were either nonshocked (NS) or shocked ( ) in the presence of the oxidizing agent copper phenanthroline. When shocked in the presence of copper phenanthroline the majority of 10C/91C exists as  pentamer, independent of the length of the -terminal truncation (left and central panels). ladder of monomer through pentamer is already present in the nonshock sample; pentamer becomes the major band when osmotically downshocked in the presence of copper phenanthroline; this occurs in  time-dependent manner (right panel). Note that no detergent solubilization before resuspension in Laemmli sample buffer is performed in these experiments. 1640 PROTEINSCIENCE.ORG Oligomeric State of MscL:  Pentamer\n\ncritical role in the oligomeric state of the protein when it is solubilized in detergent. Different deter- gents seem to have different abilities to alter MscL oligomeric structure. It appears that LDAO is the harshest detergent in this sense, leading to oligo- meric rearrangement of the full-length SaMscL pro- tein. DDM and perhaps other detergents can lead to rearrangements of only the truncated, not FL, SaMscL.13 However, there also appear to be species differences; from the OCAM study, the FL EcoMscL appears to form hexamers as well as pentamers when solubilized in DDM. In addition, the same study demonstrated that truncation of the MtMscL did not destabilize the pentameric organization when solubilized in DDM.13 Hence, detergents alone can cause specific protein complexes to rearrange their oligomeric state while others appear stable. As detergent solubilization is  critical and necessary step to obtain membrane proteins for crystallization and other biophysical and structural studies, where possible,  complementary set of data assessing the oligomeric state in vivo seems advisable.

It is one of the best characterized mechanosensors known, thus serving as  paradigm of how such molecules sense and respond to stimuli. In addition, the fact that it can be genetically modified, expressed, isolated, and manipulated has led to its proposed use as  triggered nanovalve for various functions including sensors within microelectronic array chips, as well as vesicular-based targeted drug release. -ray crystallography reveals  homo- pentameric complex with each subunit containing two transmembrane  -helices (TM1 and TM2) and  single carboxyl terminal  -helix arranging within the complex to form  five-fold cytoplasmic bundle (CB), whose function and stability remain unclear. In this study, we show three routes that throttle the open channel conductance. When the linker between the TM2 and CB domain is shortened by deletions or constrained by either cross linking or heavy metal coordination, the conductance of the channel is reduced; in later two cases, even reversibly. While having implications for the stability of the CB, these data also provide routes for engineering MscL sensors that are more versatile for potential nanotech devices. Keywords Osmoregulation; Conductance; Nanopore; Biosensor; Drug-release device The mechanosensitive channel of large conductance, MscL, is  bacterial channel located in the cytoplasmic membrane that protects cells from lysis upon acute decrease in external osmotic environment by releasing cytoplasmic osmolytes. This channel was first identified in . coli, and most functional studies have been undertaken in this species. MscL homologue from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which has 67% similarity, has been resolved by -ray crystallography and shown to be  homopentamer, with each subunit containing two transmembrane   helices (TM1 and TM2), of which TM1 forms the pore of the channel and TM2 is exposed to the lipid bilayer. Although  more recent crystal structure of MscL from . aureus shows  tetrameric complex, this appears to be  detergent-specific oligomeric organization not reflecting  physiological state; in vivo essentially all channels are pentameric. The pentameric channel opens by the expansion of both TM1 and TM2 in response to tension in cell membrane. 11 The channel also contains  single carboxyl terminal   helix from each subunit that together assemble into  -helix cytoplasmic bundle *Correspondence: 5323 Harry Hines Blvd., Dallas, TX 75390, USA. .

It remains unclear what the function of the CB is, and whether or to what extent the bundle is dissociated during channel gating. Previous studies have shown that the . coli MscL channel has  very large pore size, greater than 30 ,12 which has caused some researchers to speculate that it could be used in nanodevices. Indeed, it has many properties that would make it ideal for use as  triggered nanovalve in such devices. It can be translated in vitro13 or synthetically synthesized, reconstituted into lipids, and yet spontaneously assemble into  functional complex.14 Since introduction of charges into the channel pore lumen can gate the channel in the absence of membrane tension,, 15 18 . coli MscL has been engineered into controllable nanovalves that detect alternative modalities including light19 and pH.20 The channel has been shown to be functional in vesicular-release devices,19 21 as well as in an engineered microelectronic array chip;22 its large pore size yields  robust response in such devices. However, for some purposes  smaller or adjustable pore size would be of advantage. The data presented within this study on . coli MscL have two aspects: first, they resolve the issue of whether the CB disassociates upon normal channel opening, and second, they demonstrate that the MscL nanopore response can be effectively and reversibly modulated, which would have advantages in an assortment of potential nanodevices. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Disassociation of the -terminal   helical bundle is not required for normal gating and conductance of the MscL channel As shown in Figure 1a, the -ray crystal structure of the . tuberculosis MscL channel shows  pentameric structure in which the five subunits, at the -terminal, form an   helical cytoplasmic terminal bundle (CB). The conformation, functional role and stability of the CB of the MscL channel have remained controversial. We reasoned that if the CB was indeed  helical bundle and was stable even upon gating, the sieve-like structure suggested avenues for controlling channel pore size and conductance by constraints and deletions within this area. The CB was originally revealed in the crystal structure of the . tuberculosis MscL, but it adopted what appeared to be  non-stable confirmation with negatively charged residues facing each other. Subsequently, Anishkin et al. proposed  more stable conformation for the CB based on the crystal structure of the pentameric cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP), which has  consensus motif, ALQDVRELLR, similar to that of the MscL CB, LLxEIRDLLK.23 The COMP crystal structure showed  strongly amphipathic helix in which all apolar residues are packed inside the fivefold bundle. In an attempt to address the correctness and the stability of this proposed structure for the CB, Anishkin et al. mutated the pairs of leucines predicted to face each other to cysteines within the consensus motif; these formed cross bridges between subunits, as anticipated from the authors  proposed structure, yet normal channel activity was observed.23 The authors interpreted these data as suggesting not only that their proposed structure was correct, but that the CB remained intact upon gating. Subsequently,  re-evaluation of the MscL crystal structure24 confirmed the more stable conformation of the CB. However,  site-directed spin labeling study on . coli MscL revealed  significant difference in the structure of the end of TM2, which was explained by several possibilities, including that the -terminus of each channel subunit might not assemble into CB but, instead, fold toward the membrane interface establishing specific tertiary contacts with TM2.25 In addition,  more recent study using atomic force microscopy noted that the bundle appeared to be missing in  spontaneously opened MscL mutant, suggesting that the CB was not as stable as predicted and did indeed disassociate upon gating.26 In critically evaluating the Anishkin et al. study, we noted that the patch Yang et al.

NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript\n\nclamp traces were obtained at threshold- rather than saturating-stimulus conditions. But patch clamp is exquisitely sensitive, detecting single molecular events, while the cysteine crosslinking at these sites is extremely inefficient. It therefore seemed possible that the activities observed in the Anishkin study could simply be the channels that contained little or no crosslinking. We therefore performed experiments where saturating stimulus was applied to  L121-122C/ L128-129C mutant to determine whether the opening of this CB is required for normal . coli MscL channel gating and conductance, we mutated all four leucine residues in the amphipathic motif, which are predicted to face each other,23 24 to cysteines (L121-122C and L128-129C). This allowed for stabilization of the CB by the formation of disulfide bridges. As seen in Figure 1b, and consistent with  previous study,23 the extent of cross linking in individual MscL complexes varies, giving  ladder of MscL monomers to pentamers in  non-reduced SDS PAGE gel as visualized by Western. Given that patch clamp records single molecular events, it is possible to observe  minority of channels, presumably only those that contain no disulfide bridges and thus have normal sensitivity and gating properties. To control for this possibility, we measured the total current from all channels within the patch by using  saturating stimulus. In this experiment, the total MscL current under ambient conditions was ,176 pA. After addition of oxidizing agent Cu- phenanthroline of  mM in bath solution for 20 min, the total MscL channel current in the same path was ,240 pA, demonstrating that few or none of the channels were locked closed or in  substate. Upon application of 10 mM DTT for 20 min to bath solution, the total MscL channel current was measured to be ,080 pA, demonstrating that no channels were revealed under reduced conditions. Cu-phenanthroline and DTT treatment also did not appear to change the mechanosensitivity of MscL L121 122C, L128 129C; the ratio of pMscL/ pMscS threshold, as described previously 27 and in the Materials and Methods, was . . before and after cu-phenanthroline treatment ( > .05, paired  test,  = ). These results definitively show that disassociation of the CB is not required for normal gating and conductance of the MscL channel. Deletions within the TM2/CB linker lead to channels with decreased conductance Although it is clear that disassociation of the CB is not required for normal gating, it is still useful to know whether the CB, when not constrained, normally dissociates during channel gating. If the CB does not disassociate, then deletions within the TM2/CB linker of . coli MscL, which is similar to length as that shown for the . tuberculosis structure in Figure , should lead to constraints of the TM2 movement or decreases in the size of the  sieve , thus modifying the membrane tension mechanosensitivity threshold or lowering conductance. To test this hypothesis, we kept the CB intact and deleted different ranges of amino acids from the TM2/CB linker of . coli MscL. All point histogram analyses revealed that single channel currents from MscL  110-112 were 73. . pA,  range significantly lower than that of wild type (WT) MscL channel (84. . pA) (Table ). The MscL  110-115 channel, which had  more significant deletion, had  further attenuated single channel current with most of the single channel openings below 30 pA (Table ). The pMscL/pMscS of MscL  110-112 and MscL  110-115 were . . and . ., respectively, with the latter significantly increased relative to that for wild type MscL (. .) (Table ). Hence, the  110-115 mutant was significantly less sensitive to membrane tension. Representative current traces and all point histograms of wild type MscL, MscL  110-112 and  110-115 are shown in Figures  and . These data contrast studies in which half of the TM2/CB linker as well as the entire CB were deleted. For example, the MscL  110-136 deletion mutant has no apparent change in either mechanosensitivity or conductance.23,27 28 More recently, it has been shown that  similar  95 119 . aureus truncated channel assembles into  normal pentameric complex in vivo4  and effects relatively normal channel Yang et al.

As shown in Figure 4a, the resulting G22C/ 110-112 mutant had spontaneous openings after MTSET+ treatment that were similar to the MscL G22C alone. All point histogram analyses showed that, when gated by MTSET+, single channels of G22C with the  110-115 deletion indeed opened primarily to allow lower currents of . . pA, while G22C opened mostly to allow larger currents of 19.",

All point histogram analyses showed that, when gated by MTSET+, single channels of G22C with the  110-115 deletion indeed opened primarily to allow lower currents of . . pA, while G22C opened mostly to allow larger currents of 19. . pA (Table ). Moreover openings of G22C MscL at 56. . pA could also be seen, but were not prominent in the deletion mutant. These two mutants were observed to open at 74. . pA and 76. . pA only in very rare instances. The representative traces of the spontaneous opening of MscL G22C and G22C/  110-115 are shown in Figure 4a. These data are consistent with  stable CB: the shorter the cytoplasmic linker, the higher the restriction imposed on the TM2 movement or the smaller in sieve size, and thus the smaller and less stable the open pore size. The small conductance of G22C with  110-115 suggests  small channel pore size and likely  decreased ability to translocate larger compounds. We therefore performed  calcein efflux assay on liposomes reconstituted with the G22C/ 110-115 mutant MscL proteins, as previously described.19 21 Liposomes loaded with 50 mM calcein have  low fluorescence signal due to self-quenching of the dye at this concentration. When calcein is released from liposomes into the bulk solution, however, its apparent fluorescence increases. As shown in Figure 4b, G22C/ 110-115 MscL had  much reduced calcein efflux compared with G22C MscL consistent with pore size reduction; no calcein efflux was observed from liposomes not reconstituted with the MscL protein. Disulfide crosslinking of the TM2/CB linker decreases channel conductance The TM2/CB linker is potentially  highly dynamic region; thus constraining this region should lead to  channel with decreased conductance; we therefore mutated the three alanines at positions 110 112, which are approximately in the middle of the TM2/CB linker, to cysteines. The formation of disulfide cross links between MscL A110-112C channel subunits was confirmed by Western blot (Figure ), where dimers, trimers, tetramers and pentamers were measured. For these experiments . coli had  reducing environment in the cytoplasm, which was maintained by glutathione and thioredoxin systems.29 Thus, as previously described,30 when bacteria release these endogenous reducing agents upon osmotic shock, more cross linking between different subunits was observed. As expected, osmotic downshock itself increased crosslinking, and together with Cu-phenanthroline treatment it showed the most pronounced crosslinking (Figure 5a). Patch clamp recordings under ambient conditions showed that MscL A110-112C opens under normal levels of stimuli, but does not open to  full and normal unitary conductance. However, after DTT was added to the bath solution to cleave the disulfide bridges, the conductance of the channel significantly increased (Figure 5b). The variance observed for the conductance of MscL A110-112C is presumably due to the different amounts of cross linking within individual channels. Representative traces of MscL A110-112C before and Yang et al. Page  ACS Nano. Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 February 28. NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript NIH-PA Author Manuscript\n\nafter DTT treatment is shown in Figure 5c. DTT treatment did not alter the mechanosensitivity of MscL A110-112C channel (pMscL/pMscS threshold was . . before DTT treatment and . . after DTT treatment, Table ). There is also no significant difference between the mechanosensitivity of MscL A110-112C and wild type channel (Table ). Together, these data demonstrate that the conductance of the MscL channel can be specifically decreased by the generation of disulfide bridges within the TM2/ CB linker then restored on disulfide cleavage. Bundling the TM2/CB linker by engineering  heavy metal binding site within it allows for the reversible decrease in channel conductance We have previously demonstrated that MscL channel activity can be modulated by heavy metals subsequent to engineering  heavy metal binding site within the pore.31 Therefore, it seemed possible that  similar approach may allow  reversible alteration in MscL conductance. Toward this end, we generated two MscL histidine mutants: A110H and A112H. The presence of Zn2+ could theoretically coordinate the histidine residues within the complex, and therefore lead to what was effectively cross linking at the specific sites mutated. All point histogram analyses showed that the single channel current of MscL A110H and A112H were 74. . pA and 80. . pA, respectively. ZnCl2 treatment in the bath solution indeed dramatically decreased the single channel current of MscL 110H and 112H to 35. . pA and 43. . pA (Table ), respectively. Interestingly, the open dwell time of the main opening of MscL after ZnCl2 treatment is significantly increased, suggesting the unexpected stabilization of  substate. The effect of ZnCl2 on the conductance of both mutants was reversible after ZnCl2 was washed out. The representative current traces and all point histograms of MscL A110H and A112H are shown in Figure . The pressure required to open MscL A110H was unchanged (138. 13. mmHg before ZnCl2 treatment and 133. 13. mmHg after the treatment, Table ); The pressure for MscL A112H showed only  modest decrease in sensitivity (136. 14. mmHg before ZnCl2 treatment and 150. 16. mmHg after treatment, Table ). ZnCl2 had no effect in the conductance and pressure threshold of the wild type MscL channel, which is consistent with  previous study.31 Thus, cross linking at A110H or A112H by heavy metal coordination could effectively and reversibly decrease the conductance of MscL channel. Implications for nanotech-devices There is growing interest in the use of biosensors in nanotechnology. For such purposes, these results add to the argument that the MscL nanovalve is extremely pliable. Previous studies have shown the modality of the MscL sensor can be changed to light or pH.19 20 In addition, the permeation of specific charged molecules can be adjusted.32 Here we demonstrate that conductance, and likely the pore size can also be modified via three different methods. Modifying MscL modality and permeation, adjusting the pore size has implications in the versatility of the MscL nanovalve in nanodevices. For example, one group has proposed using MscL as  triggered nanovalve in drug-release devices.20 The wild type MscL channel has  huge pore size of greater than 30  , which allows facile translocation of both large and small compounds. Modifying the length of the cytoplasmic linker would allow one to now engineer  MscL nanovalve with throttled pore that will only pass smaller molecules. Thus, if two engineered MscL nanovalves responsive to different stimuli are used within  single vesicular-based nanodevice, stimulus-dependent differential release of drugs or other payloads through the nanovalve could be contemplated. Other groups propose using ion channels as molecular switches in tethered lipid bilayers on  chip surface;33 34 indeed, MscL has been reconstituted and shown to function in such  microchip device.22 In this system, the ability to reversibly decrease the channel conductance may be of advantage. One could imagine modulating the conductance of MscL A110-112C by changes in redox conditions. Such modulation could be useful in  resetting  Yang et al. Page  ACS Nano.

However, the variability in the type and extent of cross linking at C110-112 may limit this approach. On the other hand, Zn coordination of 110H or 112H leads to controlled, reversible, and characteristic changes in channel behavior with the primary conductance being reduced by half. In summary, this contribution illustrates three additional routes to extend the flexibility in engineering  MscL nanovalve with  set of desired properties, including  variable pore size. The range of MscL modification makes these channels more versatile for use in an assortment of nanodevices. CONCLUSIONS We have demonstrated that the CB is quite stable, even upon channel opening. This finding suggested that the MscL nanovalve can be engineered to have  smaller pore size and conductance by decreasing the TM2/CB linker, which appears to serve as  molecular sieve. The linker can easily be modified in at least three ways: shortening by deletions, or constraining the region by either cross linking or heavy metal coordination; in later two cases the decreases in pore size are even reversible. These results provide routes for engineering MscL sensors that are more versatile for potential nanotech devices. METHODS Strains and cell growth The . coli MscL mutants were generated using the Mega Primer method as described previously.35 Mutants were inserted within the pB10b or pB10d expression construct,  modified pB10b plasmid.27,36 37 . coli strain PB104 ( mscL:Cm)36 was used for in vivo assays and electrophysiological analysis. Cultures were routinely grown in Lennox Broth (LB) medium (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NY, USA) plus ampicillin (100 /ml) in  shaker-incubator at 37  and rotated at 250 cycles/min. Expression was induced by addition of  mM isopropyl- --thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (Anatrace Inc, Maumee, OH, USA). IN VIVO disulfide trapping Overnight cultures were diluted :100 and grown   at 37  in LB. LB with   NaCl was then added for  final concentration of . . Cultures were then induced with  mM IPTG for   when an OD 600 of . was reached. Cultures were either Mock shocked (. NaCl in LB media) or shocked in water (with or without 15   Cu-phenanthroline) at  :20 dilution for 20 min at 37 . Samples were pelleted at ,000  for 20 min and immediately re-suspended in non-reducing sample buffer, adjusted for final OD, and run on  % 20% gel (Bio-Rad) for Western blot analysis. 30,38 The primary antibody anti-Penta His (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) was used at :,000 and the secondary Goat anti-Mouse HRP (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at :40,000. Blots were developed using HRP substrate (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) and exposed to film. Electrophysiology . coli giant spheroplasts were generated and used in patch-clamp experiments as described previously.38 39 Excised, inside-out patches were examined at room temperature under  membrane potential of  20 mV. Patch buffers used are 200 mM KCl buffer composed of 200 mM KCl, 90 mM MgCl2, 10 mM CaCl2, and  mM HEPES (Sigma, St. Louis, MO).

As previously described,,15,32   mM MTSET+ (-(trimethylammonium)ethyl methanethiosulfonate bromide) (Toronto Research Chemicals Inc, North York, Canada) was applied in bath solution (Cytoplasmic side of MscL) and single spontaneous opening of MscL channel with G22C or G22C plus  110- was achieved by opening  single channel via suction to allow access of MTSET+.

The MscL proteins were tagged with  multihistidine tag at their -terminal ends. The histidine-tagged MscL proteins were purified12 and reconstituted into lipid vesicles composed of in molar 70 % ,-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-- phosphocholine, 10 % Cholesterol and  % ,-distearoyl-sn-glycero-- phosphoethanolamine--[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000] (Avanti Polar Lipids Inc., Alabaster, AL, USA). After protein reconstitution was performed at 60   for 30 min in the presence of Anapoe--100 (Anatrace Inc.), calcein was added and allowed to equilibrate with the liposomes at room temperature for 20 min. The detergent was removed by biobeads incubation overnight at  . Free calcein was then removed by passage through  -50 fine Sephadex column (GE Healthcare Inc., Piscataway, NJ, USA) washed with vesicle buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM sucrose, pH .). Vesicles were placed into clear 96-well plates and their fluorescence was recorded at 538 nm with the excitation at 485 nm using  Fluoroskan Ascent (Thermo Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). The baseline of samples was recorded for  min followed by 30 min recording in the presence of  mM MTSET+. Vesicles were finally lysed by the addition of . % Triton -100 to determine the total fluorescence levels of calcein encapsulated in vesicles. Acknowledgments The authors thank Drs.

    "text": "RESEARCH ARTICLE Open Access TNO1,  TGN-localized SNARE-interacting protein, modulates root skewing in Arabidopsis thaliana Rahul Roy1,, and Diane . Bassham1,,* Abstract Background: The movement of plant roots within the soil is key to their ability to interact with the environment and maximize anchorage and nutrient acquisition. Directional growth of roots occurs by  combination of sensing external cues, hormonal signaling and cytoskeletal changes in the root cells. Roots growing on slanted, impenetrable growth medium display  characteristic waving and skewing, and mutants with deviations in these phenotypes assist in identifying genes required for root movement. Our study identifies  role for  trans-Golgi network-localized protein in root skewing. Results: We found that Arabidopsis thaliana TNO1 (TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein),  putative tethering factor localized at the trans-Golgi network, affects root skewing. tno1 knockout mutants display enhanced root skewing and epidermal cell file rotation. Skewing of tno1 roots increases upon microtubule stabilization, but is insensitive to microtubule destabilization. Microtubule destabilization leads to severe defects in cell morphology in tno1 seedlings. Microtubule array orientation is unaffected in the mutant roots, suggesting that the increase in cell file rotation is independent of the orientation of microtubule arrays. Conclusions: We conclude that TNO1 modulates root skewing in  mechanism that is dependent on microtubules but is not linked to disruption of the orientation of microtubule arrays. In addition, TNO1 is required for maintenance of cell morphology in mature regions of roots and the base of hypocotyls. The TGN-localized SNARE machinery might therefore be important for appropriate epidermal cell file rotation and cell expansion during root growth. Keywords: trans-Golgi network, Root movement, Cell file rotation, Tethering factor, Microtubules Background Establishment of the root system of  plant is crucial for efficient anchorage and nutrient acquisition. Root devel- opment and architecture are well-studied [] but our understanding of how roots interact with soil components is still incomplete. This is due in part to the difficulty of visualizing roots as they move into the soil, although recent developments such as the GLO-Roots platform aid in imaging this process [, ]. Root growth into the sub- stratum presents multiple cues to the root tip such as mechanical obstacles, moisture and nutrient gradients. These cues are integrated and then signal downstream processes involving hormonal pathways and cell expan- sion []. This leads to  cumulative physiological response driving root movement and establishing the root architecture. Studying and simulating root movement and direc- tional growth in the laboratory on synthetic growth media has revealed distinct movement types, and some of the genes and pathways that control them []. Roots of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings display various growth behaviors depending on external conditions. When em- bedded in  homogeneous medium (penetrable agar), roots grow downward in response to gravity and show minimal deviation from the gravity vector. By contrast, when roots are subjected to multiple directional cues, complicated growth patterns occur [].

This arises due to  com- bination of touch [], gravitropism [], circumnutation [], and physical interaction between the root tip and the growth medium []. Skewing and waving roots display  characteristic twisting of epidermal cell files along the root, referred to as cell file rotation (CFR). When roots of Arabidopsis seedlings skew and wave, the succession of sinusoidal waves alternate between left-handed and right-handed CFRs, which correlates with their rightward and leftward movement respectively [, ]. According to Rutherford and Masson (1996), skewing is described as rightward or leftward when viewed from the back of the plate [] while handedness of the CFR is defined as left-handed or right-handed when viewing the axis of the root point- ing shootwards. Roots of Arabidopsis grown on  slanted, hard medium exhibit  dominant left-handed rotation around the growth axis resulting in  predomin- antly counterclockwise/left-handed epidermal CFR. This usually corresponds to  rightward skewing when seen from the back of the plate [, , 10]. CFR also typically correlates with an oblique microtubule (MT) array orientation in the twisting cell files, although exceptions do exist [11]. Multiple factors such as external cues (.. moisture, light or gravity), hormonal pathways, and cytoskeletal and cell wall dynamics influence the direction of root growth []. External cues signal changes in hormone signaling pathways, including auxin [12 14], ethylene [, 15], cyto- kinin [16] and brassinosteroid pathways [17]. Downstream of hormonal and environmental perception, changes in the cytoskeleton and in cell wall deposition patterns modulate cell division and cell expansion dynamics, thus mediating root movements. Defects in tubulin structure or activity or in MT-associated proteins result in altered MT dynamics and array orientation. This then leads to changes in cell expansion and affects CFR and skewing [18, 19]. Cell wall properties and the trafficking of cell wall components to the plasma membrane are key to root elongation and movement as inferred from the altered root movements observed in mutants defective in cellu- lose deposition, wall-anchored proteins or crosslinking of cell wall components [20 22]. Sorting of cell wall components occurs at the trans- Golgi network (TGN),  tubulo-vesicular organelle that matures from the two or three trans- most cisternae of the Golgi [23]. It acts as an early endosome, receiving endocytosed cargo as well as directing vacuolar and secretory traffic, with distinct subdomains that function in various trafficking routes [24 30]. Specific membrane fusion factors called SNAREs (soluble -ethylmaleimide  sensitive factor attachment protein receptors) maintain vesicle trafficking fidelity and cargo sorting within cells [31]. The TGN-localized SYP4 (41/42/43) SNARE family is required for multiple transport pathways that in turn regulate auxin homeostasis and disease resistance [30]. SYP61, another TGN-localized SNARE that interacts with SYP41, functions in vacuolar trafficking and secretion of cell wall enzymes such as cellulose synthase and pectin- polysaccharide-modifying protein. This indicates  role for SYP61 in trafficking of cell wall components and enzymes for their synthesis and modification [32 34]. TNO1 (TGN-localized SYP41-interacting protein) is  TGN- localized coiled-coil protein that interacts with the SYP41 SNARE machinery. Mutant plants lacking TNO1 (tno1) partially mis-sort vacuolar cargo, mis-localize SYP61 and display altered TGN dynamics and slower gravitropic responses [35, 36]. Trafficking at the TGN plays  role in auxin responses, trafficking of cell wall components, and cell expansion, all of which are important for root growth and move- ment. In addition, gravitropic bending is delayed in tno1 roots, suggesting defects in directional growth of roots. We therefore investigated  potential function for TNO1 in root movement. We report here that TNO1 acts as  negative regulator of root skewing, since tno1 mutant roots have enhanced skewing which also correlates with an enhanced CFR. Methods Plant material and growth conditions Arabidopsis thaliana Col- (wild-type, WT) and tno1 knockout mutant (SALK_112503) were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center; the comple- mented tno1 mutant was generated previously in our laboratory [35]. Arabidopsis seeds were surface-sterilized in 33% bleach, .% (/) Triton -100 for 20 min, rinsed  times with sterile water and kept in the dark at    for at least  days before being subjected to the root skewing and waving assays or drug sensitivity assays described below. Arabidopsis hypocotyls were analyzed by plating sterilized seeds on .5X solid Murashige- Skoog (MS) medium [(Murashige-Skoog vitamin and salt mixture, Caisson, MSPA0910] with % sucrose, . mM MES (pH .), and .% (/) Phytoblend agar (Caisson, PTP01) and growing vertically at 22   in the dark. Root skewing and waving assays Skewing and waving assays were performed as described [, 37]. Arabidopsis plants were grown at 22   in long- day conditions (16  light) on .5X solid Murashige- Skoog (MS) medium (Murashige-Skoog vitamin and salt mixture, Caisson, MSPA0910) with % sucrose, . mM MES (pH .), and .% (/) Phytoblend agar (Caisson, PTP01). Seedlings were grown vertically for  days after Roy and Bassham BMC Plant Biology (2017) 17:73 Page  of\n\nwhich the root tip position was marked. The plates were then slanted backwards, 30o to the vertical, and grown for another  days. Images of the roots were acquired from the back of the plate using  Nikon SMZ1000 light microscope equipped with  Nikon S10 CoolPix camera. Analysis of root parameters was performed using Image  [38]. Root tip deviations to the right from the back of the plate were considered positive while deviations to the left were considered negative. Root morphometric analyses were performed as described [39]. Images of skewing/waving roots were analyzed with the ImageJ software [38] for measuring root tip abscissa (Lx) and length of the root () followed by calculation of horizontal growth indices (Lx/). Drug sensitivity assays Seedlings were grown vertically on plates containing either taxol (Paclitaxel, Sigma Cat #T7191) or propyza- mide (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat #45645) at the indicated concentrations for  days and skewing angles of roots were determined. Dark grown hypocotyl cell phenotypes were analyzed by placing -day-old hypocotyls on the surface of warm % low melting point agarose on  slide [40] and then imaging the imprints with  Zeiss Axioplan II light microscope. Cell file rotation analysis and propidium iodide staining The root surface of Arabidopsis seedlings was visualized using  Zeiss macro-zoom microscope at the Microscopy and NanoImaging facility, Iowa State University. Alter- natively, roots were stained with propidium iodide (ThermoFisher Scientific Cat #P3566). Seedlings were dipped in  working aqueous solution (10  /ml) of propidium iodide for  min and then washed twice by dipping in petri dishes filled with water for 30 . The roots were mounted in water and visualized using  Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP5; Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Con- focal and Multiphoton Facility. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 nm and 617 nm respectively. Laser power, scan frequency and line averaging were optimized and kept constant between samples and replicates. CFR angles of the roots were calculated as described [, 41] using ImageJ [38]. Immunostaining and analysis of microtubules Five-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings grown on slanted medium were fixed and immunostained as described [42]. Mouse anti- - tubulin antibodies (Sigma-Aldrich, Cat #T6074), diluted :100, were used for immunolabel- ing of MTs followed by AlexaFluor 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (ThermoFisher Scientific, Cat #A11029) as  secondary antibody, diluted :500. Cells within the elongation zone were imaged by confocal microscopy with  Leica confocal laser scanning microscope (Leica SP5; Leica Microsystems) at the Iowa State University Confocal and Multiphoton Facility, using  40X (.25 NA) or 63X (. NA) Leica oil immersion objective. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 nm and 507 nm. Laser power, scan frequency and line averaging were optimized and kept constant between samples and replicates. Confocal images were analyzed with the freely available software package MicroFilament Analyzer (MFA) [43], and data was displayed as circular plots as generated by the software. MT angles generated by the software were classified into three classes,  to 10, 11 to 30 and 31 to 90 degrees using Microsoft Excel and used for subsequent analysis.

NA) Leica oil immersion objective. Excitation and emission wavelengths were 488 nm and 507 nm. Laser power, scan frequency and line averaging were optimized and kept constant between samples and replicates. Confocal images were analyzed with the freely available software package MicroFilament Analyzer (MFA) [43], and data was displayed as circular plots as generated by the software. MT angles generated by the software were classified into three classes,  to 10, 11 to 30 and 31 to 90 degrees using Microsoft Excel and used for subsequent analysis. Results Loss of TNO1 results in exaggerated root skewing Mutants lacking TNO1 have normal root elongation, but show  lag in root gravitropic bending upon gravisti- mulation [36]. Positive gravitropism is  key component driving root waving and skewing, and hence we hypothe- sized that TNO1 might play  role in these processes. To test this hypothesis, -day-old seedlings were grown vertically on the surface of hard agar medium (.% agar), the plates tipped over by 30o, and the seed- lings allowed to grow for an additional  days (Fig. 1a). The slant forces the root tip to press against the impene- trable medium due to positive gravitropism. As the root fails to penetrate the medium, cell expansion and circumnutation drive the root to the side and this alter- nates between rightward and leftward corrective devia- tions resulting in characteristic waving and skewing responses [, ]. tno1 mutant roots (KO) formed sinus- oidal wave-like growth patterns similar to WT (Col-) roots but had an exaggerated rightward skew compared to the WT roots, when seen from the back of the plate (Fig. 1b). tno1 mutants complemented with transgenic TNO1 under the control of its own promoter (COM) [35] had reduced skewing compared to the mutants and were similar to the WT roots (Fig. 1b). Root images were analyzed using ImageJ [38] and quantified for devi- ation of the root tips from their position at the time of slant initiation ( ) (Fig. 1c) [, 39]. tno1 mutants had  higher angle of deviation than the WT or complemented roots (Fig. 1d;  < .05). To confirm the difference in phenotype, another morphometric parameter, the horizontal growth index (HGI), was calculated for the skewing roots. HGI is the ratio of the root tip abscissa (Lx) and length of the root () (Fig. 1c) and is  sensitive and robust parameter to quantify lateral directions of growth, independent of root shape [39]. Root tips skewed to the right yield positive Lx values and negative values when roots skew left. positive Lx results in  positive HGI value, which then signifies  rightward Roy and Bassham BMC Plant Biology (2017) 17:73 Page  of\n\ndeviation while  negative value suggests leftward devi- ation [39]. tno1 roots had  significantly higher HGI than WT and complemented lines (Fig. 1e;  < .05), confirming that the tno1 mutants do indeed have an in- creased rightward deviation from the vertical. Skewing tno1 roots display enhanced root epidermal cell file rotation (CFR) The cellular basis for CFR is still not completely under- stood, but has been proposed to be  result of the circum- nutation of the root tip [20]. Circumnutation is dependent on an internal mechanism that results in an elliptical or cir- cular trajectory around an imaginary axis of growth [44]. The helical pattern of cell division at the root tip has been hypothesized to be the basis for epidermal CFR [, 10, 37]. The characteristic spiral cell division patterns of the outer circle of meristematic cells in the root apex causes  spiral- ing of the cell files, thus resulting in CFR formation [45], although this fails to explain why CFR initiates at the base of the elongation zone, away from the site of initial cell divisions. lag in anisotropic expansion rates between the epidermal and the inner cell layers can also cause  twisting of the cell files to compensate for stresses and strains that might otherwise cause tissue breakage []. CFR, usually preceding root bending and skewing [41], is visible at the base of the elongation zone of skewing roots. Rightward- skewing mutants usually display  dominant left-handed CFR [, 11]. We therefore hypothesized that the enhanced rightward skewing in the tno1 mutants would correlate with an increase in left-handed CFR. Microscopic analysis of mutant roots showed  marked left-handed epidermal CFR initiating in the root elongation zone (black arrow, Fig. 2a) while WT and complemented roots mainly have  vertical arrangement of cell files with  lack of distinct CFR in this region (Fig. 2a). Confocal im- aging of propidium iodide-stained roots revealed  distinct- ive left-handed CFR with  higher twist in the elongation zone of tno1 lines compared to the WT and complemented lines (Fig. 2b). Images were analyzed with ImageJ to quan- tify the left-handed twist of the cell files relative to the lon- gitudinal axis of the root. The tno1 CFRs were significantly higher ( < .01) than the WT and complemented root CFRs (Fig. 2c). This may explain the enhanced skew of the mutant roots, since the increased left-handed twist might cause larger deviations from the axis of growth. Skewing of tno1 roots is enhanced upon MT stabilization by taxol CFR can be caused directly by altered cortical MT organization, which influences anisotropic expansion as Fig. Loss of TNO1 protein function causes increased rightward root skewing.

Several mutants defective in MT stability, organization and dynamics have enhanced right- or left- ward skewing, with  dominant left or right-handed CFR respectively [18]. Many, but not all, also display  hand- edness of the cortical MT arrays that is opposite to the CFR handedness of the elongation zone of the roots. Some mutants defective in MT-interacting proteins show right-handed CFR, skew to the left, and display left-handed helical cortical MT arrays in the elongation zone [48, 49], while others have skewing defects but normal transverse MT array orientation in the root elongation zone. This suggests that the relationship between MT dynamics, orientation, and skewing is com- plex. We hypothesized that the enhanced skewing and CFR in tno1 mutants might also be due to changes in cortical MT array organization or dynamics. TNO1 is lo- calized to the TGN, and this hypothesis receives support from  recent study in which  TGN-localized protein was shown to activate  kinesin and be involved in root skewing and gravitropism, linking MTs and the TGN in the root skewing process [50]. The MT-stabilizing chemical taxol causes MT bundling and enhances rightward skewing in WT roots [, 51]. When grown vertically on increasing concentrations of taxol (Fig. 3a), tno1 roots showed significantly higher rightward skewing than the WT and complemented lines (Fig. 3a, ). The percentage increase in the skewing angle of the mutant roots from    to . taxol is signifi- cantly higher ( < .05) than in the WT and complemen- ted line roots (Fig. 3c). We hypothesized that this increase in skewing was due to an increase in the left-handed twist of the roots. Analysis of confocal images of propidium iodide stained roots in the presence of . taxol re- veals  larger left-handed CFR in the tno1 roots compared to WT and complemented lines (Fig. 3d, ). The pheno- type is reflective of the effect of taxol on the root growth rather than the effect of  slanted substratum, since the drug assay is conducted on vertically-oriented plates. These results suggest that MT stabilization exaggerates the root skewing and CFR phenotype of the tno1 mutants. Effect of MT destabilization by propyzamide (PPD) on root skewing in tno1 mutants The MT-destabilizing chemical propyzamide (PPD) also enhances rightward skewing in WT seedlings []. Since the effect of MT stabilization on root skewing in tno1 seedlings suggests  MT-based role for TNO1 in root movement, we tested the effect of PPD on root skewing in the tno1 mutant. WT and complemented roots showed  slight increase in rightward skew at    PPD and  marked increase at    PPD. Surprisingly, skewing of tno1 mutant roots was insensitive to PPD (Fig. 4a, ). The percentage increase in skewing observed for WT and complemented roots in the presence of PPD was signifi- cantly higher than in tno1 (Fig. 4c).

While the TNO1 transgene in the com- plemented lines is expressed under its native promoter and its overall expression levels are similar to that of the endogenous protein, position effects within the genome may cause slight differences in expression pattern in different cell types. We hypothesized that the reduced skewing of tno1 roots in the presence of PPD would correlate with  reduced CFR when compared with CFRs of PPD treated-WT and complemented roots. Confocal micro- scopic analysis of the surface of roots growing on    PPD reveals  twisting of WT and complemented epider- mal cell files. The mutant root epidermal cell files also display considerable left-handed CFR, indistinguishable from WT and complemented lines (Fig. 4d, ). Hence, the resistance of tno1 roots to PPD-induced skewing is independent of PPD-induced CFR. To explain this observation, we hypothesized that the PPD treatment might have other effects on the mutant roots, including effects on root growth or morphology.

Surprisingly, mature regions of tno1 roots grown on    PPD had more severe defects in cell morphology when compared to PPD-treated WT and complemented lines, with the mutants displaying malformed cells (Fig. 5a). Whereas PPD-treated WT and complemented roots have typical long, narrow cells, tno1 mutant root cells are shorter and wider, indicating defects in anisotropic growth. This points to  possible defect in cell maturation or cell wall de- position that could potentially interfere with the ability of the tno1 roots to skew in the presence of PPD even as the CFR in the elongation zone continues to form nor- mally. It is possible that the defects in the mature zone of the PPD-treated tno1 roots could then affect how the growing root interacts with the substrate, which would in turn affect root skewing. To assess whether other organs and cell types in the mutant might also be sensitive to MT disruption by PPD, we analyzed agarose imprints of control and PPD- treated dark-grown hypocotyls. The base of the hypo- cotyls in the WT and complemented lines had cells with increased width when compared to their untreated counterparts. tno1 hypocotyls were hypersensitive to PPD, with much more severe defects in cell morphology when compared to the untreated tno1 seedlings and to Fig. Effect of MT destabilization by propyzamide (PPD) on root skewing in tno1 mutants.

The PPD-treated tno1 seedlings also lacked the spiraliza- tion of the cells observed in the treated WT and comple- mented lines. As observed in the skewing assay, the complemented lines were slightly more sensitive to PPD than WT, which again may be due to position effects. Cell elongation is initiated at the base of dark grown hypocotyls [52], and the loss of TNO1 may lead to an increased susceptibility of this cell expansion process to MT destabilization by PPD. Treatment with low concen- trations of PPD (such as   ) has been reported to cause  decrease in the dynamic instability of cortical MTs, leading to more static MTs that spend more time in the paused state compared to untreated cells [53]. Our results suggest that the disruption of MT dynamics by PPD has  more adverse effect on tno1 roots than WT. This could be manifest as defects in MT-array organization, anisotropic expansion, or both, resulting in the observed disruption in cell morphology in tno1. The orientation of MT arrays in the elongating cells of skewing tno1 roots is not affected MT arrays in elongation zones of roots are usually ar- ranged in  transverse orientation to facilitate aniso- tropic expansion. Skewing roots of some mutants with marked CFRs have distinct oblique arrays of MTs, with the handedness of  MT array opposite to that of CFR [18]. Strong correlations have also been observed be- tween angle of skewing and pitch of the MT arrays [11]. Many mutants that are defective in MT-associated processes have  change in the pitch of MT arrays asso- ciated with  corresponding change in CFR. However, some mutants with enhanced CFR show no obliqueness of the MT array, but rather have transverse arrange- ments similar to the central elongation zone cells of the WT roots. For example, the sku6 mutant maintains  transverse alignment of MT arrays despite its left- handed CFR [, 54] while the mor1  mutant, impaired in MT polymerization, also displays  left-handed CFR but no bias in MT array orientation [55]. These mutant phenotypes suggest that additional factors can also be responsible for  change in CFR, apart from the MT array orientation. We hypothesized that the dominant left-handed CFR in the tno1 roots would correspond to  right-handed MT array in the epidermal cells of the elongation zone compared to WT roots. Four-day-old chemically fixed WT and tno1 roots, grown on  slanted impenetrable medium, were immunostained with tubulin antibodies [42] to detect MTs and imaged by confocal microscopy. The MT arrays of epidermal cells in the mutant roots did not show any distinct handedness or change in pitch compared to WT epidermal MT arrays (Fig. 6a). Quanti- tative analyses on collected images were performed util- izing the MATLAB software package MicroFilament Analyzer [43] to allow comparison of MT orientation in multiple images from different biological replicates. The representative circular output graphs from the analyses suggest  mainly transverse orientation of the MTs in the elongation zone of both WT and tno1 roots (blue Fig. Effect of    propyzamide (PPD) on cell morphology of the mature region of the root and the base of the hypocotyl.

To assess whether  difference in the percentage of oblique MTs between the WT and mutant might explain the higher CFR in the mutants, MT angles of root cells from WT and tno1 roots were classified into three classes,  to 10, 11 to 30 and 31 to 90 degrees (Fig. 6c). No significant difference was found in the percentage of MTs in each class between the WT and mutant. Thus we conclude that tno1 mutants have normal transverse MT arrays in the skewing roots, suggesting that an alternative mech- anism must be responsible for the change in CFR. Discussion TNO1 plays important roles in post-Golgi trafficking, gravitropism and auxin transport-dependent processes. Here we demonstrate that TNO1 is required for root skewing and CFR formation. Skewing of tno1 mutant roots increased to  greater extent upon MT stabilization by taxol when compared to WT roots but was resistant to MT destabilization by PPD. This led us to postulate  role for TNO1 in MT-dependent processes, although MT destabilizing agents have also been reported to in- duce left-handed CFR without affecting MT arrays [53]. In roots, MT arrays transition from  disordered state in the meristematic zone to  transverse orientation in the elongation zone, and this organization is important for facilitating rapid anisotropic growth [42]. Defects in tubulin structure/activity and in MT-associated proteins can result in oblique MT arrays in the central elongation zone of roots. Oblique MT orientation in elongating cells causes cells to expand at an angle to the vertical, leading to CFR and root skewing [, 20, 56, 57]. Skewing roots of tno1 do not show an oblique MT orientation in the elongation zone but rather  transverse one. This suggests that the root movement phenotype in tno1 mutants arises independent of the organization of MT arrays in the root elongation zone, although dependent on MT dynamics. It is possible that, despite its normal orientation, the cortical MT array in tno1 roots might be compromised in restructuring or function as the root navigates  complex trajectory during skewing. The loss of TNO1 could potentially also affect the function of  MT-associated protein such as  kinesin; as an example,  TGN-localized kinesin-binding separase has recently been reported to affect root skewing [50]. Certain root skewing mutants have transverse MT arrays or  lack of directional bias in the MT arrays in the root elongation zone but have  distinct CFR [54, 58, 59].

This suggests that the MT array is not the only factor in- volved in generating CFR. Owing to anomalies such as these, Wasteneys (2004) proposed that CFR could arise due to torsional handedness inherent to roots, and the correlation between CFR and MT array orientations could result from signaling between the MT array and cell wall machinery. Thus, CFR could arise from the effect of MT arrays on anisotropic expansion in the elongation zone or, alternatively, from the effect of cellulose microfibrils on MT array alignment at the plasma membrane [46, 47]. Mutants that affect CFR formation but not MT array orientation in the elongation zone support this model, in- cluding mutants defective in regulation of anisotropic cell expansion [20, 54]. Based on this model, and consistent with the cell morphology phenotypes observed in the presence of PPD, TNO1 might be important for the aniso- tropic cell expansion process or in cell wall trafficking dynamics. lag in the expansion rates of internal cell types com- pared to the epidermal cells may cause roots to skew to prevent mechanical shearing [, 57]. The mature root cells and hypocotyls of tno1 seedlings treated with PPD showed marked disruption of cell morphology, suggesting  role for TNO1 in the cell maturation or expansion process. This model would also explain why tno1 roots skew des- pite the transverse MT arrays in the epidermal cells of the root elongation zone. Vertically-grown tno1 seedlings have similar root lengths to WT seedlings, suggesting normal cell expansion during vertical growth. Thus TNO1 might be required specifically for cell expansion during deviation of roots from their growth trajectory. During cell expansion and cellulose deposition, the cellulose synthase complex traffics via the TGN [60, 61]. The observed defects in cell morphology and expansion could be due to the role of TNO1 in proper localization of the TGN-localized -SNARE SYP61 [31, 32]. Prote- omic analysis of SYP61-containing vesicles [34] revealed the presence of cellulose synthase complex subunits, suggesting  role in trafficking of cellulose synthase subunits, which then drives cellulose deposition. MT array dynamics modulate the deposition of cellulose mi- crofibrils in expanding cells since cellulose synthase runs parallel to the MT array, with CELLULOSE SYNTHASE INTERACTIVE1 acting as  link between the cellulose synthase machinery and cortical MTs [62 65]. MTs also regulate exocytosis of vesicles containing cellulose syn- thase complex subunits or complex-associated proteins such as KOR1 and CSI1 [66 68]. Disrupting MT arrays therefore affects cellulose synthesis, deposition and orientation, while conversely, inhibiting cellulose syn- thase activity causes defects in MT arrays [69, 70], which can potentially affect directional growth patterns [18]. Inhibitors of cellulose synthase trafficking such as CES- TRIN cause MT instability and reduced cellulose content, and increase SYP61 and cellulose synthase co-localization [68]. Since CESTRIN does not affect the bulk secretory and endocytic routes, the SYP61-decorated domain of the TGN and its associated proteins such as TNO1 seem to be cru- cial for cellulose deposition and, indirectly, MT stability. However, mutations in cellulose synthase components (rsw1 , any1) or treatment with cellulose synthase inhibi- tors does not induce CFR [58, 71, 72]. Moreover, Sugimoto (2003) also reports that  cellulose synthase mutant can undergo CFR even when the MTs are compromised [58]. Trafficking of other proteins required for cell expansion and root movement might also be disrupted in tno1 mu- tants. For example, SKU5 is required for enzymatic reac- tions at the cell wall, and mutants lacking this protein show enhanced root skewing possibly due to altered cell wall composition during cell expansion [20]. Our observations suggest that CFR formation involves complex interactions and is not simply dependent on MT array and cellulose de- position patterns. Current models of the mechanisms of helical growth have been challenged by studies on tortifo- lia2 mutants, in which individual freely growing trichomes twist. These mutants therefore uncouple cell division pat- terns and tissue strain from twisting and suggest that indi- vidual twisting of cells can translate to higher-order organ twisting [73]. Understanding the exact role of TNO1 at the TGN and the mechanism by which it modulates CFR and skewing will thus be  challenge. Our results suggest that TNO1 and the TGN play  key role in CFR and root movement, adding another component to the network controlling root movement. Further experiments are necessary to test the exact role of TNO1 and its interacting partners in regulating root skewing and CFR formation. Future studies investigating TNO1  role in cellulose synthase trafficking, MT stabil- ity and cell expansion dynamics in skewing roots will increase our understanding of the function of TNO1. Since TNO1 affects auxin transport [36], our study now points to the possibility of an impact of TNO1 on auxin transport, MT dynamics and cell wall trafficking at the TGN. Discovering TNO1  precise role will help in eluci- dation of the function of the TGN SNARE machinery in plant growth and morphogenesis. Conclusions In conclusion, we have discovered  role for  TGN- localized protein in root skewing on the surface of impene- trable media. This adds to the growing list of endogenous factors that aid root movement. Our data, alongside prior investigations, also suggest  possible link between TNO1, auxin-dependent and MT-associated processes. better understanding of these mechanisms can lead to informa- tion that can be used to manipulate root growth and Roy and Bassham BMC Plant Biology (2017) 17:73 Page 10 of\n\ndevelopment patterns in various soil conditions and improve overall root architecture.

Immune function in particular is relevant for space travel. Human immune responses are weakened in space, with increased vulnerability to opportunistic infections and immune- related conditions. In addition, microorganisms can become more virulent in space, causing further challenges to health. To understand these issues better and to contribute to design of effective countermeasures, we used the Drosophila model of innate immunity to study immune responses in both hypergravity and spaceflight. Focusing on infections mediated through the conserved Toll and Imd signaling pathways, we found that hypergravity improves resistance to Toll-mediated fungal infections except in  known gravitaxis mutant of the yuri gagarin gene. These results led to the first spaceflight project on Drosophila immunity, in which flies that developed to adulthood in microgravity were assessed for immune responses by transcription profiling on return to Earth. Spaceflight alone altered transcription, producing activation of the heat shock stress system. Space flies subsequently infected by fungus failed to activate the Toll pathway. In contrast, bacterial infection produced normal activation of the Imd pathway. We speculate on possible linkage between functional Toll signaling and the heat shock chaperone system. Our major findings are that hypergravity and spaceflight have opposing effects, and that spaceflight produces stress-related transcriptional responses and results in  specific inability to mount  Toll-mediated infection response.

However, turning the exploration of space into  practical reality presents daunting challenges including conquering the compromised biological functions produced by spaceflight. In order to achieve space exploration,  better understanding of human biology, both on earth and in space, is required. Among the many aspects of biology affected by spaceflight, we have focused on the immune response. Immune dysfunction is  major health-related problem on earth and  major obstacle to long-term space missions []. As early as the Apollo and Skylab missions, immune dysfunction was recognized in astronauts, and later studies documented specific host cellular and humoral immune alterations induced by spaceflight []. Increased microbial growth and virulence in space have also been documented []. Spaceflight is associated with many stresses, with altered gravitational force () representing the most studied factor. Microgravity (mg) is constant in space, and hypergravity (hyper ) is experienced during launch and landing. Immune dysfunction in both mg and hyper  is well documented, but determination of the underlying cellular mechanisms and thus PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org  January 2014 | Volume  | Issue  | e86485\n\nroutes to appropriate countermeasures, remains unresolved [,,,,]. Without normal immune function, many threats to long-term survival in space exist: fatal infections, failed immuno- surveillance of cancer cells, aberrant inflammatory responses and reactivation of latent viruses are all potential hazards. In our work, we have brought advances in understanding the host defense of Drosophila to bear on deciphering the immune alterations associated with altered gravity and spaceflight. Dro- sophila is  well-established model for human innate immune function, sharing elements in cellular and humoral immunity, clotting and wound healing, and signaling pathways []. Drosophila responds to microbial infection with )  systemic response, characterized by fat body production of antimicrobial proteins (AMPs), ) tissue specific responses, such as production of AMPs in the gut and trachea, ) phagocytosis by hemocytes, and ) clotting and wound healing [,,,10]. Two signaling pathways are the main mediators of the response to bacterial and fungal infections in Drosophila [,11,12]. The Toll pathway primarily responds to fungal and Gram-positive (Lys-type peptidoglycan (PGN)) infections, and the Imd pathway responds to Gram-negative (DAP-type PGN) infections []. Toll- like receptors (Tlrs) have been identified in mammals and are the direct mediators of responses to activators such as bacterial lipopolysacccharide and viral DNA [13]. Imd shares homology with the death domain of the mammalian Receptor Interacting Protein of the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor pathway []. Downstream, through the conserved NF-kB/Rel protein tran- scription factors relish (Imd signaling cascade), and DIF and dorsal (Toll signaling cascade), the AMPs and ,400 other genes are involved in response to infection [,14,15]. Recognition of the complexity of the Toll and Imd pathways continues to grow, for example with identification of new regulators, interactions with the nervous system, and modification with aging [16,17,18,19]. In contrast to mammals, in Drosophila only the original Toll was associated with infection response, through indirect sensing mediated by binding to Spa tzle (Spz). More recently however, other Toll family members have been identified as mediating infection. Toll- regulates infection response in the airway epithelium [20], and Toll- is involved in viral recognition and response [21]. The mechanisms of interactions within and between the Toll and Imd pathways and other systems are not fully understood, and unraveling the interrelationships will require many approaches. Here, we present genetic and transcriptional profiling experiments to address the response to infection in conditions related to space travel: Does hypergravity affect the response to fungal infection? Does development during spaceflight alter the response to bacterial and fungal infections? Results and Discussion Hypergravity Increases Survival after Infection with Pathogenic Fungus The first goal was to test our hypothesis that the immune response of Drosophila would be affected by changes in gravity at the organismal level. The simplest immune function assay is post- infection survival, and  straightforward route for altering gravity is to achieve hyper  through use of centrifuges similar to the human centrifuges used for training pilots. We infected with . bassiana, an entomopathogenic fungus that enters through the cuticle and is well studied with respect to survival kinetics and Toll pathway activation []. Infected and control flies were then exposed to hypergravity on  centrifuge maintained at the Chronic Acceleration Research Unit (CARU), UC Davis. The survival of wild type and immune response mutants (except Toll pathway mutants which do not survive infection long enough for prolonged hyper  experiments) was assessed. Strikingly, all strains showed increased post-infection survival at hyper  (Figure 1A bottom panel, 1B wild type, imd and Thor strains). Given that mg is associated with impaired immune function, one interpretation of this result is that hyper  exerts the opposite effect and boosts the host response. Opposite effects of opposing gravity vectors are not uncommon, for example for platelet functions [22]. However, microorganisms can become more virulent at mg [], and an alternative explanation is that at hyper  the fungus itself is less virulent. In an attempt to distinguish between host and fungal responses, we tested  gravitaxis mutation of the gene yuri gagarin (yuri) [23]. yuri encodes  isoforms of  coiled-coil protein that is ubiquitously expressed, and two mutations have separate tissue specific functions related to mechanotransduction [24,25,26]. The yuric263 allele, caused by  GAL4 enhancer trap insertion, has defective gravity responses. UAS-yuri construct, driven by the c263 transposon, rescues this phenotype through expression limited to mechanosensory neurons [23], indicating defective gravity sensing in the yuric263 mutant. We hypothesized that if host response to hyper  were primary, then aberrant gravity sensing in yuric263 might modify the hyper  post-infection response, but if the fungal response were primary, then post-infection survival of yuric263would be comparable to that of wild type and the immune function mutants (Figure 1AB). On testing, yuric263 failed to show this increased post-infection survival, whereas the yuri rescue strain had the typical increased survival response (Figure 1AB). Thus, these data demonstrate  significant host component to the hyper  effect. How might hyper  increase post-infection survival? The yuri finding could indicate  neural route linking mechanical load sensation to immune response. Mechanical load also affects cell biological processes [27], and one possibility is that endocytosis, which is essential for Toll signaling [28], is enhanced at hyper . Interestingly, Yuri protein appears to have membrane-associated functions [26]. The immune response is energetically expensive, and flies with greater energetic reserves may have greater post-infection survival. However, survival did not correlate with stores of triglycerides, carbohydrates or protein (Figure 1C). The Fungus, Immunity, Tumorigenesis (FIT) Microgravity Experiment These results showing that the immune response of Drosophila responds to  force formed the basis for the space shuttle experiment Fungus, Immunity and Tumorigenesis (FIT). FIT is the first flight experiment to investigate mg effects on Drosophila immunity. The FIT experiment was flown on the shuttle Discovery (STS-121), and involved an experimental design adjusted for shuttle conditions. Ideally the design would have paralleled the hyper  work, with infection of Drosophila genotypes proceeding in space. But due to flight constraints, space infections were not possible and only  single genotype could be flown. However, the flight duration (12 days) allowed production and return to Earth of  small population of flies that had undergone their entire development in space (space flies). Upon return this population was divided into three groups and used for transcription profiling without infection and after infection with . bassiana or . coli. The fungal spores and . coli used were grown on Earth. Earth-reared flies, grown at Kennedy Space Center, were used as controls (Earth flies). Recordings relayed from the shuttle ensured similar growth conditions for the space and Earth flies other than the change in  force.

In stark contrast, none of these gene categories was upregulated in space flies (Figure ). The AMPs Metchnikowin and Drosomycin are key indices of the Toll signaling response []. Figures  and 4A present transcrip- tional analysis by quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and microarray-based analysis establishing the failed induction of these two genes in space flies. Results of microarray-based analysis for additional genes are also presented in Figure 4A. Note that necrotic (nec) is upregulated in the Earth flies, which is an indicator of  strong anti-fungal response since Nec downregulates the immune reaction via negative regulation of Persephone (Psh) [29]. complete listing of the fold changes and associated  values for all the transcriptionally modulated genes of the categories shown in Figure  is presented in Table S1. Collectively, these data indicate that Toll mediated responses to . bassiana are impaired in space flies, and in particular the failure of Drosomycin and Metchnikowin activation indicates that the space flies are severely immunocompromised. The data do not, however, reflect  complete failure of the space flies to react to the infection. Some defense response category genes were activated in space flies as well as Earth flies (Figure  and Table S1), and these indicate that signaling pathways other than Toll are functional in space flies. Some of these genes are Turandot (Tot) family members,  set of genes induced under  variety of stresses such as septic infection, paraquat feeding, UV exposure and heat shock, and with complex regulation involving the Jak-Stat, Imd and Mekk1 pathways [30,31,32]. Also induced in both space and Earth flies are the fungal infection response genes Thioester containing protein IV (Tep IV), which has an alpha-macroglobulin complement component, and Transferrin  (Tsf1), which is predicted to be involved in iron homeostasis. Both of these genes are also induced in response to DNA damage in the larval epidermis, as is Tot  [33,34]. The only AMP gene induced in space flies by the fungal infection is Drosomycin-like  (Drsl5) (Figure 4B). Drsl5 induction in response to . bassiana is regulated by both the Toll and Imd pathways []. Thus induction of Drsl5 in the space flies is not necessarily evidence for  functional Toll response and may represent activation by the Imd pathway (see below) or another route. Both space and Earth flies upregulated genes associated with response to toxins, including cytochrome P450s (Cyp4ac1, Cyp4ac2, Cyp4aa1, Cyp304a1), which are associated with detoxifi- cation of xenobiotics and hormone metabolism [35,36] (Table S1). Genes induced uniquely in the space flies by fungal infection could indicate an altered infection response. However, only one category of genes emerged from microarray analysis as specifically induced by infection in space flies: oxidation/reduction (Figure  and Table S1). Six of the eight genes in this category are Pyrroline -carboyxlate reductase (P5cr), probable cytochrome P450s (Cyp6t1, Cyp6t1 and Cyp6a13), CG6012 and CG10131. The remaining two genes, phenoloxidase subunit A3 (PO45) and prophenol oxidase A1 (proPO- A1), have roles in melanization, which is also used as  defense against pathogens and in wound response [37]. However, other genes in the melanization cascade were upregulated in Earth flies but unchanged in the space flies, .. MP1, Spn27A and Hayan [38,39]. In contrast, Gram-negative binding protein  (GNBP3) is upregulated in space flies, and GNBP3 assembles defense complexes, including phenol oxidases, in  Toll independent manner [40]. Initial detection of . bassiana infection occurs through dual signaling arms upstream of Spz, the only known ligand for Toll [16,41]. In one arm, Psh, moderated by suppression from Nec, Figure . Microarray-based analysis of response to . bassiana. The total number of genes upregulated or downregulated in Earth flies only (Earth) or space flies only (Space) or in both (overlap) are indicated by Venn diagrams. Pathway analysis of each of these groups is shown on the right side of the figure. The number of genes in each functional category is depicted in bar graphs (primary -axis), and the  values corresponding to statistical over-representation of each category are presented as  line graph (secondary -axis). Note that certain genes annotated into more than one of these categories. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0086485.g002 Gravity and Spaceflight Alter Drosophila Immunity PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org  January 2014 | Volume  | Issue  | e86485\n\nsenses fungal virulence factors and other danger signals, leading to activation of the Spa tzle Processing Enzyme (SPE), cleavage of the Spz prodomain, and binding of processed Spz to the Toll transmembrane receptor [29]. In the other signaling arm, GNBP3 binds fungal cell wall components and initiates  cascade via ModSP and Grass that also leads to SPE activation and Spa tzle binding to Toll [16,42]. Thus, if space flies are defective in initial sensing of the infection,  minimum of two defects are needed to block both arms of the upstream signaling cascade. If the space flies are not defective in sensing,  single non-functional step at the level of SPE or further downstream in the Toll pathway could prevent the activation of target genes. The Imd Pathway is Activated Normally in Adults Raised in Space In complete contrast to fungal infection, space flies infected with . coli show strong gene expression responses similar in character to those of Earth flies (Figure ). For both Earth and space flies, expected categories of upregulated genes [,14,15] were statisti- cally over-represented: innate immunity, response to bacterium and humoral immune response (Figure ). Accordingly, the Imd pathway appears to have been activated normally in the space flies. Table  presents  subset of these genes categorized into AMPs, Peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs), Turandot, Immune induced molecules, Thioester-containing proteins, and Miscellaneous. Table S2 details all of the transcriptionally upregulated and downregulated genes in the categories presented in Figure . Drosomycin and Metchnikowin are included among the standard AMP genes activated by . coli infection (Table , Figures  and ). Despite its activation by  Gram-negative organism, Drosomycin is mainly considered  readout for Toll signaling through cross recognition extracellularly or cross talk intracellularly with Imd or another pathway [16]. As discussed below, our hypotheses on the effects of mg on Toll function would suggest the cross-reaction is downstream of Toll receptor activation. Metchnikowin has both antibacterial and antifungal activity, and can be activated transcriptionally through Imd or Toll, depending on the type of infection [43]. Thus the normal induction of Metchnikowin in the bacteria infected space flies, but lack of induction in the fungus infected space flies, characterizes the normal Imd signaling versus the abnormal Toll signaling of the space flies. Adults Raised during Spaceflight have an Altered Transcriptional Profile Comparing the transcription profiles of uninfected space and Earth flies provides valuable insights into the biological processes affected by the mg environment and thus generates clues as to the origin of the differing effects on Imd and Toll mediated responses. These comparisons may also provide evidence relevant to the enhanced post-infection survival at hyper . The transcriptional profiles of uninfected space and Earth flies were compared by first hierarchically clustering genes that were differentially expressed between the two groups (Figure ). Pathway analysis indicated the transcripts expressed at higher levels in space flies included  statistical over-representation of genes linked to stress response, inosine monophosphate (IMP) metabolism, response to hypoxia, wing disc morphogenesis, and apoptosis. much smaller list of transcripts was expressed at lower levels in space flies than Earth flies, and appeared to be enriched in genes associated with symporter activity, oxidation/reduction, and structural molecule activity (Figure ). Several immune response genes were also differentially expressed, but were not statistically over-represented as  functional category: relish (. fold), spa tzle (. fold), dorsal (. fold), virus-induced RNA (. fold), Serpin 28Db (. fold), serine peptidase CG18563 (. fold), pirk (. fold), and PGRP-LF (. fold). In total, less than only 280 genes showed  significant difference in expression between space and Earth flies (Table , Table S3). Interestingly, 127 of these genes are uncharacterized and only identified as CG numbers [44], and may also be of interest in the spaceflight and immune context as more information is acquired. Current annotations show that the most striking alterations are in expression of heat shock protein genes,  subset in the stress response category (Table ). The heat shock response is evolutionarily conserved and perhaps the most well studied stress response [45]. Heat shock proteins also function under normal conditions, and in general act as molecular chaperones assisting in forming, or regaining, the normal folding of polypeptides, translocating proteins, and regulating protein degradation [45,46]. The heat shock response occurs in reaction to many types of stress and is usually initiated by unfolded/misfolded proteins. In correcting this cytotoxic state heat shock proteins also inhibit apoptosis [45,47]. Given their functions, it is not surprising that heat shock gene expression changes have been associated with altered gravity and spaceflight in  variety of organisms; however, Figure .

Two further categories of altered gene expression are notewor- thy with respect to the heat shock result seen for the space flies: apoptosis and response to hypoxia (Table ). Six genes associated with apoptosis are upregulated: starvin, which is  cochaperone associated with heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) [52]; the caspase Damm, which can trigger apoptosis when overexpressed [53]; Pdk1, Figure .

The response to hypoxia category includes  subset of the heat shock protein genes and hairy,  master regulator for adjustment to hypoxia [58]. Together these transcriptional alterations indicate severe stress associated with protein unfolding during development of the flies in mg. Do these changes in the space flies provide insight into the failed immune response to fungal infection versus the robust immune response to bacterial infection? Although differences in the physiologies of the two infections, .. acute infection by the non- pathogenic .coli and chronic infection by the pathogenic . bassiana, may play some role here, the strong heat shock response produced by the space environment offers two testable molecular hypotheses. Hypothesis . The extracellular space is more susceptible to protein unfolding in stress conditions than the intracellular environment. Thus in the mg conditions experienced by the space flies, the more complex extracellular induction events associated with Toll activation (recognition, activation of SPE, cleavage of Spz and binding to Toll) are more susceptible to disruption than those associated with activation of the Imd pathway. For the Imd pathway, the extracellular event is direct binding of bacterial components, PGN, to cell surface receptors, PGRPs [19]. corollary of this hypothesis is that, in time, the heat shock proteins may mediate recovery of Toll signaling. Hypothesis . Heat shock protein() interferes directly with the binding of (processed) Spz to Toll. In mammals, extracellular heat shock proteins bind directly to Tlr receptors and are important in moderating the immune response, including in the clinical setting [59,60,61]. In contrast in Drosophila, Spz is the only known ligand for Toll [16,42]. Heat shock proteins do not, however, need to be Toll ligands in order to interfere with Spa tzle binding, or to inhibit activity of essential upstream components such as SPE, Psh and Grass. corollary is that heat shock proteins may be both positive and negative regulators of the Toll signaling pathway, inhibiting or enhancing according to the conditions. This corollary is analogous to the positive and negative regulation of Tlrs effected by extracellular heat shock proteins in mammals [62]. These hypotheses on heat shock protein mediation of the effects of  force on immune responses have broad implications, providing insights into established findings, suggestions for further experimentation and predictions for other stressful conditions. One clear, testable, inference is that the compromised human immunity seen at altered  results from protein unfolding and heat shock protein engagement. Our hypotheses also suggest an underlying mechanism for our hyper  findings. Thus hyper  may stabilize proteins against unfolding or affect heat shock protein interaction with Toll receptors. Effects on the stability, folded status or function of endocytotic components may be particularly important both at hyper  and mg since endocytosis is essential for Toll, but not Imd, signaling [28]. further possibility is that most common stresses such as sleep deprivation, physical activity, and ageing, affect immune responses via these proposed routes. Other studies have noted the opposing effects of increased and reduced  force on expression of individual Drosophila genes in uninfected flies [50,63]. In addition, in one mg experiment, Figure .

In the future, experiments on board the International Space Station (ISS), where multi-generational studies with multiple strains of flies and pathogens are possible, would provide an optimal route for testing the hypotheses suggested here. Other factors that might affect microgravity immune responses - such as the route for pathogen delivery, developmental events, microbiome, and signaling path- way modulation by epigenetics or non-coding RNA activity - could also be addressed. The key to applying the full capacity of Drosophila aboard the ISS for an understanding of gravitational effects on innate immunity will be the use of  wide range of pathogens, genotypes, and approaches by many different investi- gators. The juxtaposition of our mg and hyper  findings highlights the importance of gravity in normal immune function and begins to elaborate the key cellular and molecular components of the immune system that respond to changes in gravity. Our findings also suggest that exposure to gravity may mitigate the deleterious physiological, including immune, consequences of spaceflight and provide  rationale for including human centrifuges on facilities for long-term transport and housing of humans in space. Materials and Methods Drosophila Stocks All experiments used only males. Oregon- wild-type flies were used. Others are: imd1 (Flybase FB, FBal0045906), yuric263 and UAS-yuri (FBgn0045842 and [23]), Thor2 and Thor1rev1 (FBgn0261560 and [65,66]), spz4 (FBal0016062) and imdEY08573 (FBal0159146) [44]. The stock for the space and Earth flies, hemolectin-Gal4; UAS-GFP, expressed GFP in the blood cells [44]. The space containers are presented in Marcu et al. [64]. Microorganisms and Infections Bacterial infections with . coli ATCC 25922 were as previously described [65,67]. single spore isolate of Beauveria bassiana (strain GHA) was cultured on Sabouraud dextrose agar. Conidia and hyphae were harvested by passing culture through  sterile ASTM No. 100 sieve. Spores were also flown on the space shuttle and we are happy to provide information upon request. Natural infection by . bassiana used  dosage of .56106 spores/fly, with procedures and survival assays as previously described [67]. Ten replicates of 20 flies each for all strains were used in all  experiments for the CARU hypergravity tests. The centrifuge was stopped once per day to conduct survival counts. Control survival assays after bacterial and fungal infections on wild-type, hemolectin-Gal4; UAS-GFP, imd1, imdEY08573 and spz4 [67] were conducted at Kennedy Space Center to establish that space and Earth fly infections were proceeding in accordance with our standardized conditions.
